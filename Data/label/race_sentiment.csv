CLARKSBURG, W.Va. (WDTV) - Recent events involving African Americans and police officers has sparked a lot of conversation on various social media sites. Many have chosen to pick a side to defend, but for LeAnn Quinn that isn't an option.

LeAnn's husband is an officer with the Clarksburg Police Department and the beautiful little girl the couple adopted happens to be African American. For Quinn, this reality led her to social media to call for unity instead of division in the wake of recent events.

""I was really upset over the things that were happening and going on, in the media. And it just came over me. It was just something that I felt in the moment and I posted it,"" said LeAnn Quinn, Harrison County resident.

The post, which featured a picture of the two people she loves most, was shared by many. Leann called for the community to fix the problem's America is facing, instead of taking sides. She says having her husband and daughter helped her to see the importance of this.

""It helps me to see both sides of what is going on,"" said Quinn.

Events like Baton Rouge and Ferguson, have seemed to become all too common. Sergeant Donald Quinn says, though we are not exempt from such incidents, he believes in our area local leaders are working to build community and officer relations.

""You have police officers, not just white police officers, but white and black police officers going out into the communities. Both white and black communities and discussing things and fostering relationships. And I think that's where you won't have incidents like what happened in Ferguson or other places,"" said Sergeant Quinn, of the Clarksburg Police Department.

Having worked in different areas and among various people himself, Sergeant Quinn says he views everyone the same and simply wants to help the community. He believes this is something most officers strive for.

""I don't think that every law enforcement officer wakes up every day. I'd say it's less that one percent wakes up every day with wanting to go to work with bad intentions. I think that I just want people to know that most law enforcement officers go to work to help people and to do their job as a law enforcement officer, and to get home safely to their families,"" said Sergeant Quinn.

To Sergeant Quinn, that family is his little girl, whose skin color he says he doesn't see, and LeAnn, who is hoping for a change in the future.

""I'm hoping that together they can come to a compromise. To understand each side and that all lives do matter,"" said Quinn.

1.81135E+11,Law Enforcement Today,181135410243_10157329043005244,Timeline Photos,"Tampa Police officer remembered for humor, heroism

TAMPA ??From the day Master Patrol Officer Fred Thomas Arnold III found a black rubber snake on the side of the road, he never missed a chance to use it against his fellow Tampa Police Department officers ??hiding the snake in places like a patrol car or a headquarters hallway.

The prankster's ever-present, infectious laugh is what his children and co-workers will miss most about him, they said Monday. Arnold, 48, died Saturday while scuba diving in southern Nevada.

""Nobody likes everybody, but everybody liked Fred,"" said Cpl. Mike Ruiz, 46, who worked with Arnold since the late 1990s. ""If he caught the bad guy and there was the compassionate way to charge the bad guy or the throw-the-book-at-you way, Fred would always pick the compassionate way. That's just the kind of guy he was.""

Arnold, a lifelong Tampa resident, always dreamed of becoming a police officer and worked with the Tampa Police Department for 27 years. When off duty, he could be found fishing or scuba diving to clear his mind.

Arnold was diving around the wreck of a B-29 bomber in Echo Bay in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area when he surfaced unconscious around 1:30 p.m. Saturday and was pronounced dead by emergency crews. The cause of death has not been released by the Clark County Medical Examiner in Las Vegas.

His family always came first, and Arnold was a constant presence in his three children's lives, they said.

His son Fred Arnold IV, 16, said he will remember the way his dad took dramatic photos of his own terrified face in the passenger's seat while teaching the boy to drive. His daughter Gabby Arnold, 18, remembers his silly advice ??don't eat laundry detergent ??when she went off to college.

He was always there when his children, or even their friends, needed to talk or snag a bear hug, and he never missed an opportunity to teach them a new skill like baking, said his oldest, Amanda Arnold, 23.

Arnold spent hours mentoring young teens through the Police Explorer program and made headlines more than once for his heroic acts while on duty.

In 1992, when Arnold was 23, he leapt through a window into a burning house to save a young mother and her two children, ages 4 and 4 months. All three were unconscious when he pulled them and the woman's 7-year-old nephew from their Main Street home.

Arnold was off duty at the time. He received an award for valor from the department in 1993.

Last year, Karine Johns of Tampa, 49, wrote a letter to the editor of the Tampa Tribune to thank Arnold for helping her when her tire blew out last fall on Interstate 4, above 22nd Street in Ybor City. She had no cellphone and was in tears as she tried to stop passing cars.

""I was shaking, that's how scared I was, and when he stopped I gave him a big hug,"" Johns said. ""He started talking to me about his kids and calmed me down and took me somewhere safe.""

Arnold's children always marveled at the stories they heard about their father, they said.

""We knew my dad was a hero"" Amanda Arnold said, ""and he's always going to be our hero.""

I write fiction for a living, but in my thrillers, I try to get the details right. So what better way to understand how a President lives for my newest thriller than by spending time with the Secret Service agents who spend so much time with him?
So there I was, on my tour of Secret Service headquarters. The agents had taken me into a small museum they have on the premises. It?™s a room lined with photos of Presidents and archival exhibit cases filled with Secret Service artifacts. A newspaper with a ?œKennedy Dead??headline. A replica of Lee Harvey Oswald?™s rifle. The pistol used to try to kill President Gerald Ford. They even have the actual car door from the limo when Reagan was shot.
It was an eerie keepsake for sure. But not nearly as eerie as the next detail they told me. We were talking about Reagan and that day he was shot. Then one of the agents offered this secret: When Reagan was President, he carried his own gun.
I couldn?™t believe it.
?œIt?™s true,??they said. A .38. Reagan used to hide it in his briefcase and take it on Air Force One.
Whatever you think of Reagan, you have to admit, he had a black belt in badassery.
Many feel that the ?œgreat communicator??was easily the best of the post-WWII Presidents and it is rather difficult to dispute them, but purely from a Second Amendment perspective, his views that evolved over the course of a lifetime are a bit more nuanced.
In 1933 Reagan pulled a .45 revolver on an armed robber, saving a nursing student that was his target.
There is anecdotal evidence that he regularly concealed carried a .32 revolver for a period of time in his younger years after he stopped that robber. Meltzer?™s story confirms that Reagan was a firm and life-long believer in carrying a concealed weapon for self-defense, even when afforded the protection of the Secret Service.
Unfortunately, Reagan?™s views on the Second Amendment were not absolute. He supported gun control in other forms at various times, from outlawing the open carry of loaded firearms in 1967 while governor of California in reaction to the tactics of the Black Panthers, to supporting the Brady Bill that was largely a response to the 1981 assassination attempt on his life. He also supported the Clinton-era 1994 assault weapons ban. Support for both of these laws came after Reagan left office.
Those Second Amendment compromises aside, President Reagan was clearly a proponent of concealed carry for self-defense, and appears to have practiced it his entire life, across the nation, without a permit. I have to think that if he were alive today, President Reagan would be a firm supporter of national concealed carry reciprocity.

Sharpton Brother Accused of Sexual Assault and Practicing Satanism
Kenny Sharpton Glasgow (photo courtesy Henry County, Alabama Reporter)
AL SHARPTON?™S YOUNGER BROTHER KENNY GLASGOW ALLEGED TO BE PERFORMING SATANIC RITUALS IN DOTHAN CHURCH
DOTHAN ALABAMA-
?œI had no reason to think he would do what he did to me, In a church if you cant be safe there, where can you???? Kim Dickerson.
A Dothan pastor, Kenny Sharpton Glasgow,  younger brother of Al Sharpton,  has been reported to have sexually assaulted a Dothan woman at his ministry. Glasgow managed to get Dickerson alone in a hallway of his church and grabbed Dickerson by the neck repeatedly, and then held her against a wall as he aggressively fondled her genitals.
Dickerson said she was shocked, and tried desperately to pull away.
?œHere is this little short man with a nub trying to feel me up. My first reaction was what the hell is wrong with you, I thought you were a preacher, and then he grabbed me again??
Dickerson told us the preacher then became more aggressive and tried to hold her against her will, holding her by the neck.
?œI pulled away and managed to push him off as the investigator interviewing my mother nearby came around the corner??
The investigator saw Glasgow?™s hand on Dickerson?™s neck but did not see where his other hand was as Glasgow was behind her.
?œI knew something wasn?™t right as she was trying to get away from him and then he shot out the door without saying anything and let go of her, it was obvious he was trying to hold her.??Dickerson said she knew from the community Pastor Glasgow was referred to as a ?œhorn dog??and could not control himself around women.
?œBut I never suspected he would do what he did to me , attack me in a church of all places. This guy needs to be stopped. Its scary, imagine if he did this to a young girl or elderly woman who was scared or to weak to fight back??
Dickerson , who is 40, intelligent, attractive, and physically strong, was at the ministry with her mother to meet an investigator working for a law firm in Montgomery to videotape an affidavit.
When asked why she had not immediately involved police, she told us,
?œI have been reluctant to come forward because of what he is involved in (witchcraft) and how he can threaten people with what he does. I also have a brother facing a trial and he has contacts in jail and they could harm him. I?™m scared of him.??We spoke with a former member of the TOPS ministry that Glasgow operates and they told us of just why so many people are scared of Kenny Glasgow.
?œPeople think they are feeding the hungry, which they do, but they also get them involved in devil worship.??



(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

When asked for specifics, she referred to multiple rituals that are satanic in nature and involve witchcraft.
?œThey use this grave dirt and other rituals to put curses on people, make them sick and have accidents??
Parallel to this incident we discovered that Reverend Sammy Parks, the uncle of Chris Thomas, a young unarmed man fatally shot by the Dothan Police Department in 2012, knows about Glasgow?™s involvement in the satanic rituals. Chris ?™s uncle recently discovered that Kenny Glasgow was going to his nephew?™s grave and retrieving dirt that was being used  for satanic rituals and black magic.
Reverend Sammy then immediately contacted various family members to request they cease having any involvement with Kenny Glasgow or the TOPS church.
?œThe ritual Glasgow is involved with has nothing to do with Jesus and the God we follow. This type of stuff is evil, and the bible clearly tells us is the work of the devil.??Sources we spoke with, in strict confidence, that fear the pastor, that used to be members of the TOPS  church, described a secret church within the church.  Some people are secretly initiated into this inner circle of followers. You don?™t want to know what they really do as it involves a lot more than dirt from people?™s graves.
?œThere are the dirt wearers, about two dozen?? she told us, ?œpriestess women who are close to Glasgow that wear the dirt they dig from people?™s graves. Some of them have normal jobs and you would never know them, one even works at the police station??
They use this dirt to put it across entryways, or where people they are using it on travel, this they believe will put Satan?™s curse and affect their health. If the person crosses that dirt, even if its a few grains of it, then Kenny Glasgow teaches the evil spirits and demons that are summoned have the power to get in their lives and affect them.
When asked who they did this to, I was told that Kenny Glasgow had a list of people that included several Houston county judges, and most importantly the officers and their families who have shot the young men he is trying to win lawsuits on. They have a serious effort to end the earthly life of the officer, Darren Moody that shot Chris Thomas and Tony Smith who shot Patrick Humphrey. Their whole families are at risk by these crazy people.
When I asked the former church member if she believed in this ?œblack magic??, she said yes, but not like he does.
?œBut I have seen things where people fall sick and cannot be cured unless they see a more powerful person who lifts the curse. The real danger is the people he is teaching this to so you have to understand they believe this and that makes them very dangerous and someone who would harm any of these people and their families if given the chance. So the evil that is brought forth is real and can damage innocent lives it just takes time to work.??I had to quit going to TOPS when I found out what they were doing. There are other rituals but I am not going to speak of them.
?˜I pray for my friends because they just don?™t know whats really going on down there??
Pastor Kenny Glasgow was caught on video in a 2013 sermon in his church where FBI agents were described as being sent to assassinate him and he and a ?œpriestess??intervened and were able to get inside their minds and order them to not assassinate Glasgow. In the video Glasgow fell to the floor speaking in tongues after this . That video is located here. A federal official we spoke with that was aware of what he was telling young people at the church, of federal agents being sent to kill him, said it was very disconcerting to say the least.
?œThe problem is there are people under his spell that really believe this stuff and they then go out on to the streets and this puts all of our community?™s sworn officers at risk, at all levels. That makes it dangerous??

The trailer for the show, which has been widely criticized by YouTube respondents, features white people expressing angst about how they are desperate not to appear ?œracist??or ?œoffend people.??According to Kimberly Ricci, the documentary forces the participants ?œto internalize what they?™ve done in America????in other words, this a huge exercise in white guilt tripping for public consumption.
An MTV write up of the show also explains how Vargas talks to young Native Americans who feel that European settlers did not ?˜save the country??
?œThey are the ones who invaded. They are the ones who took,??says Vargas.
In the interests of balance, when will Vargas be fronting a show called Black People that collectively blames all black people for black crime statistics, including the fact that black people in America commit over half of homicides despite making up only 13 per cent of the population?
How about the fact that despite being outnumbered by whites five to one, blacks commit eight times more crimes against whites than vice-versa?
How about theBarbary slave trade, under which over 1 million white Christian Europeans were enslaved in North Africa until the middle of the 18th century?
Are black people going to be shown crying on camera having been shamed into taking responsibility for all of this? No, because that would be racist. But according to MTV and Vargas, subjecting someone to trial by media purely because of their skin color is perfectly acceptable ??so long as they are white.
This documentary represents the culmination of years of race-baiting and racial division which is being driven by the mass media and the Obama White House, tensions which have rapidly accelerated since the Ferguson and Baltimore riots.


STRONG LANGUAGE WARNING:


Responses to the video trailer on YouTube were savage, with the clip receiving twice as many ?˜thumbs down??in comparison to ?˜thumbs up??
?œI?™m black, even I know this show is straight up racist. Only because it?™s stereotyping white people, all white INDIVIDUALS are not like that,??wrote one respondent.
?œYou want an uncomfortable conversation on race? Let?™s talk about violent crime stats shall we? No? I get it, you only want white people to feel uncomfortable,??added another.
?œFuck you MTV, I will NEVER apologize for the skin I was born with, nor will I apologize for being a male, or for being straight,??another respondent asserted.
However, many in the liberal media are celebrating the show, withKristen Yoonsoo remarkinghow pleased she is about the fact that, ?œlots of white people tears lie ahead.???œIt?™s always a good time poking fun at white people,??she concludes.

4.37674E+14,We the People,437674196342052_949189431857190,Timeline Photos,"CHICAGO'S DECLINE

Founded in 1837 as a small trading post, by 1883 Chicago had grown more than a hundredfold into one of America's largest cities. Then, between 1883 and 1903 its population quadrupled. Over the course of its formative decades, the Windy City was the home of such technological and commercial innovations as the first refrigerated railroad car (1878), the first mail-order retailing corporations (Sears-Roebuck in 1893 and Montgomery Ward in 1872), and the first car radio manufacture (1920s). Also during the Twenties, new construction boomed throughout the city, punctuated by the completion in 1930 of such landmarks such as the Chicago Board of Trade Building and the famed Merchandise Mart (whose 4 million square feet of office space made it the world's largest building at the time). The Great Depression and the diversion of resources into World War II subsequently stalled construction projects in Chicago for a number of years, but a postwar economic boom saw the development of huge housing tracts in the city's Northwest and Southwest Sides.

?œChicagoland,??as the city is now sometimes called, was meant to conjure a zesty sense of urban uniqueness, but the term has instead become a synonym for corrupt power politics and urban malaise in the murder capital of the U.S. On the political front, Chicago has been led exclusively by Democratic mayors for the past 83 years, since 1931. Under the progressive policies of Richard J. Daley (1955-76), Michael Bilandic (1976-79), Jane Byrne (1979-83), and Harold Washington (1983-87), the city's economic and social fabric deteriorated markedly during the 1960s, '70s, and '80s. According to urban analyst Aaron Renn, by 1976 Chicago was ?œa grim, decaying city??that ?œwas failing on nearly every measure.???œThe city,??Renn elaborates, ?œwas losing people, losing businesses, and losing jobs.... Manufacturing was collapsing and the middle class was fleeing, leading to neighborhood decline and eroding the city?™s tax base, which in turn degraded the city services residents had come to expect and demand. The decline in services and neighborhoods drove more people way, which led to further declines, perpetuating a vicious cycle.??
 In a similar vein, Chicago Tribune correspondent Richard Longworth wrote a powerful front-page series in 1981 titled ?œA City on the Brink,??stating: ?œChicago has become an economic invalid. The situation may be permanent.??The Economist, meanwhile, described the city as having little more than a ?œfacade of downtown prosperity.??University of Illinois at Chicago Professor Pierre de Vise saw ?œvery little hope for locating economic activities here again.??And a local business executive pondered, ?œIs the city being annihilated? It?™s probably inevitable.??The economic malaise that plagued Chicago during this period was accompanied by a steep decline in the city's population, which fell from 3.62 million in 1950 to 2.78 million by 1990.

 Harold Washington, an African American whose mayoralty ran from 1983-87, was a particularly significant figure in Chicago politics. An icon of the city's socialist Left, he had a profound influence on a rising young local activist (and future U.S. president) named Barack Obama. Moreover, Obama's longtime pastor, the infamous black liberation theologian Jeremiah Wright, was intimately involved in helping to mobilize black and Hispanic voters in support of Washington?™s electoral campaigns. Ideologically a socialist, Washington worked openly with the Chicago contingent of the Democratic Socialists of America. However, following a strategy that the leading socialists of that era had resolved to pursue, he never openly identified himself as a socialist. Rather, he calculated that he could most effectively advance his leftist agendas by calling himself a ?œliberal??and rising to positions of political influence under the aegis of the Democratic Party. 

 While Washington's support among Chicago blacks was overwhelming, he could not possibly have won the 1983 mayor's race without the indispensable help that socialist community organizations gave him in terms of delivering enough white votes to ensure victory. In conjunction with these organizations, Washington emphasized class-warfare themes to create what Stanley Kurtz, author and senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, has characterized as ?œan economic, anti-business Populist movement which in fact [was] controlled by Socialists from behind.???œThe idea,??Kurtz elaborates, ?œis you don?™t actually say, 'Hey, we?™re Socialists; we have a movement for Socialism here.' No. You call yourself Populist, you call yourself Communitarian, or you use Alinskyite terms like, 'let?™s democratize power.' But when you look at what?™s really going on, it comes down to Socialism, and the Socialists who ran these organizations knew it.??Kurtz explains that Washington rose to political prominence by assembling ?œa 'rainbow' coalition of blacks, Hispanics, and left-leaning whites??whose ultimate aim was to ?œpus[h] the Democrats to the left by polarizing the country along class lines.??

 While campaigning for mayor in 1983, Washington, who had once served a brief jail term for not filing his income taxes, said that he fully supported the principle of financial disclosure by public officials, which had become a popular post-Watergate reform. But once in office, he suggested that such a policy should only apply to other public officials, and that his own personal taxes were a private matter. Also during his '83 campaign, Washington vowed to reduce regressive local taxes and rely more heavily on money from the State of Illinois. Once elected, however, he raised taxes on Chicagoans by hundreds of millions of dollars. Consequently, the city's economy suffered. As one of his constituents later recalled: ?œHe raised taxes too much. All he did was tax, tax, tax.??
 Under Washington, whose mayoralty ended suddenly in November 1987 when he died of a heart attack just a few months into his second term, Chicago?™s civic life deteriorated rapidly. One clear example involved the Chicago Housing Authority?”a massive municipal agency that had been created to own and operate public housing built by the federal government?”which was brought to the brink of insolvency by his appointees. The U.S. Secretary of Education in 1987 described the city's school system?”where students were mostly poor and nonwhite?”as the very worst in America. Also during Mayor Washington's tenure, crime rates in the city exploded: Between 1982 and 1987, the annual incidence of robbery rose by 44%, while the corresponding increases for other crimes included 37% for burglary, more than 20% for both larceny-theft and auto theft, over 40% for arson, and at least 300% for aggravated assault.

 Because this unsafe environment was toxic to local retail and service establishments, many business owners simply picked up their roots and relocated to more welcoming places. All told, Chicago suffered a net loss of 45,000+ jobs during the '80s?”a period of great economic prosperity and employment growth for most of the country?”and many of the Windy City's job losses occurred on Mayor Washington's watch. Likewise, Chicago's overall population declined, on average, by more than 20,000 residents per year.

 Under Mayor Richard M. Daley (1989-2011), Chicago rebounded a bit in the 1990s when it enjoyed a lower unemployment rate and stronger per-capita income growth than either New York or Los Angeles. It also added some 560,000 new jobs and gained more than 100,000 residents. During that same period, Chicago spent billions of dollars on a host of development projects including the construction of an elevated train line to Midway Airport, a wide-ranging street-beautification initiative, and the creation of impressive cultural facilities such as the $450 million Millennium Park. ï¿?
 But in the first decade of the 21st century, these successes faded. Fiscal mismanagement by the Daley administration began to manifest itself in Chicago's economy, causing 7.1% of the city's jobs to dry up and disappear. Chicago?™s famous Loop, the second-largest central business district in the nation, was especially hard hit ?”losing fully 18.6% of its private-sector jobs. The city government, meanwhile, began incurring massive levels of debt, running an annual budget deficit of approximately $650 million.

 Contributing heavily to these shortfalls were ever-escalating expenditures on lavish benefits for Chicago's public-sector union employees, whose pensions were, by mandate of the Illinois state constitution, permanently immune to cutbacks. According to the Washington Post, Chicago today owes nearly $14 billion in outstanding General Obligation bond debt, and the city?™s pension funds owe $27 billion in unfunded obligations to police, firefighters, teachers, and municipal employees. This shortfall amounts to more than $9,900 per city resident.ï¿½In Chicago's fire department alone, unfunded liabilities exceed 650% of payroll, meaning that they total more than 6.5 times what the city spends each year to pay all of its active firefighters. Similarly, the Chicago police department's unfunded liabilities amount to just above 600% of payroll.

 In 2008 Mayor Daley sought to address his city's budget deficit, in part, by means of a fundraising gimmick that, rather than promoting fiscal responsibility, succeeded only in squandering additional mountains of cash while saddling future generations of Chicagoans with an unprecedented debt burden. Specifically, Daley authorized his now-infamous parking-meter lease, whereby?”in exchange for $1.1 billion up front?”the city sold its right to 75 years worth of parking revenues to the private company Chicago Parking Meters LLC. Just two years into the deal, the city had already spent 84% of that $1.1 billion.

 Also in typical Democrat fashion, Chicago politicos have repeatedly sought to balance their budgets by raising local property and sales taxes. Today Chicago has the nation?™s highest sales tax rate, whose impact on the city is amplified by Illinois' already-high state taxes. According to a March 2013 Wall Street Journal report, the state and local taxes currently paid by Chicagoans are higher than those paid by their counterparts in all but four other American cities. This oppressive tax climate has dealt a painful blow to Chicago's residents and business owners alike.

 In July 2013, Moody's Investors Service?”citing Chicago's ?œvery large and growing pension liabilities and accelerating budget pressures associated with those liabilites?â€”downgraded the city's General Obligation (GO) and sales-tax ratings from AA3 to A3. Four months later, another major ratings agency?”Fitch Ratings, Inc.?”likewise downgraded Chicago?™s debt worthiness after the Illinois legislature failed to pass a budget fix.

 Another factor harming small businesses in Chicago is the system of ?œaldermanic privilege??that dominates the city's politics and serves as a fertile breeding ground for corruption. As urban-affairs analyst Aaron Renn explains, Chicago's aldermen?”i.e., city council members?”have ?œnearly dictatorial control over what happens in their wards, from zoning changes to sidewalk cafÃ© permits.???œThis,??says Renn, ?œdumps political risk onto the shoulders of every would-be entrepreneur, who knows that he must stay on the alderman?™s good side to be in business. It?™s also a recipe for sleaze: 31 aldermen have been convicted of corruption since 1970.??According to a University of Illinois report issued in 2012, Chicago is the most politically corrupt city in the United States, having averaged 51 public corruption convictions annually since 1976. 

 In Chicago's sick political climate, failure to adhere dutifully to the demands of the mayor and his power structure typically spells doom for any business enterprise. As the City Journal puts it:

?œ[A]n even greater problem than outright corruption is Chicago?™s culture of clout, a system of personal loyalty and influence radiating from city hall. Influencing the mayor, and influencing the influencers on down the line, is how you get things done.... One?™s standing is generally not, as in most cities, the result of having an independent power base that others must respect; it is the result of personal favor from on high.??
Chicago's entrepreneurs are further handicapped by the byzantine regulations and red tape that make it prohibitively expensive and complicated to run a business within the city's confines. According to Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce CEO Jerry Roper, such ?œunnecessary and burdensome regulation??has placed Chicago ?œat a competitive disadvantage with other cities.??The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, for its part, has described the litigation environment of Cook County as the most unfair and unreasonable of any jurisdiction in the United States.ï¿½ï¿½

 Chicago's fiscal woes are compounded by the poor economic conditions that pervade much of Illinois, where egregious financial mismanagement has plunged a once-thriving state economy into virtual ruin. The state's job-creation rate ranks a lowly 48th in the U.S., and its $9,624 in public debt per capita is second only to New York's. Largely as a consequence of this runaway debt, two of the nation's major credit-rating corporations, Moody's and Standard & Poor's, currently give Illinois the lowest credit rating of any state in the Union. Notably, Illinois is headed by a Democratic governor, a State Senate that is more than two-thirds Democrat, and a State House of Representatives that is 60% Democrat.ï¿½ï¿½

 Yet another reality that has had a severely negative impact on life in Chicago is violent crime. Since the mid-1970s, the annual homicide tally within the Windy City has ranged between 435 and 970, with the trends and fluctuations more-or-less mirroring those observable nationwide. In 2012 and 2013 it led all U.S. cities in homicides, with a combined total of 931 during that two-year period?”far more than any other American city. In 2012, approximately one in every 1,000 Chicagoans was shot (either fatally or non-fatally) at some point during that year?”a rate 6 times higher than in New York City. 

 Whites, who constitute roughly 28% of Chicago's population, commit about 4% of all homicides in the city. By contrast, African Americans, who are 35% of the population, are responsible for three-fourths of the homicides. The statistics for Chicago's black youth in particular, many of whom have become involved in a culture of gang violence, are just as grim. Between 2003 and 2008, black youngsters accounted for 78% of all juvenile arrests in the city.

 Driving the trend of stratospheric crime rates in Chicago's black community is a high incidence of single motherhood. Indeed, between 75% and 80% of the city's black children are born out-of-wedlock. For decades, empirical research has demonstrated conclusively that growing up without a father is a far better forecaster of a boy?™s future criminality than either race or poverty. Indeed, regardless of race, 70% of all young people in state reform institutions were raised in fatherless homes, as were 60% of rapists, 72% of adolescent murderers, and 70% of long-term prison inmates.

 In recent years, Chicago has been the scene of at least 50 incidents of black-on-white ?œflash mob??violence, as documented by the intrepid author Colin Flaherty. One of the most recent, high-profile incidents occurred at the end of March 2013, when some 500 blacks stormed the so-called Magnificent Mile, an upscale shopping area, randomly assaulting innocent people and wantonly destroying property.ï¿½ï¿½

 Chicago leadership's response to this type of criminality has been far less assertive than that of New York, for instance, where Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Chief William Bratton in the 1990s instituted a proactive, aggressive, and highly successful anti-crime strategy that incorporated ?œstop-and-frisk??policies and so-called ?œbroken windows??law-enforcement measures. Their approach?”which was subsequently continued, to similar effect, by Giuliani's Republican successor Michael Bloomberg?”reversed a long trend of escalating criminality that had plagued New York City in the pre-Giuliani years.

 By contrast, Chicago's politicians, community activists, and religious leaders alike have largely turned their backs on such policing philosophies. As a former Chicago deputy superintendent of police once observed: ?œWe?™d marvel at how the NYPD was getting mayoral support??during Giuliani?™s tenure in office. ?œMayor Daley [who served from 1989-2011] is not a cop supporter,??he elaborated. ?œIt?™s no secret that he rules the police department with an iron fist.??
 Chicago's failure to establish any appreciable measure of control over either its economy or its crime problem, is mirrored by the persistent inability of its lavishly funded public-school system to educate the city's children. While spending more than $13,000 annually on the education-related expenses of each K-12 student in the city?”an amount exceeding the national average by about 23%?”there is little to show for the taxpayers' financial outlays. In the 2013 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), standardized exams designed to measure students' academic abilities: 
?¢Just 21% of Chicago fourth-graders performed well enough to be classified as ?œproficient??or better in grade-level reading?”vs. 34% of fourth-graders nationally.
?¢Only 27% of Chicago fourth-graders performed well enough to be classified as ?œproficient??or better in grade-level math?”vs. 42% of fourth-graders nationally.
?¢A mere 20% of Chicago eighth-graders performed well enough to be categorized as ?œproficient??or better in grade-level reading, vs. 35% of eighth-graders nationally.
?¢Just 20% of Chicago eighth-graders performed well enough to be deemed ?œproficient??or better in grade-level math, vs. 34% of eighth-graders nationally.

Moreover, only 63% of Chicago's public high-school students graduate on time (within four years)?”a far cry from the national average of 78%. 

 Though most of Chicago's public schools have languished for years on academic watch lists, Illinois lawmakers?”beholden to the massive sums of money they receive from teachers unions?”have failed to implement any sort of voucher program by which students could escape the city's failing schools and be educated instead?”at a more reasonable cost?”in a superior private school. The Chicago Teachers Union (CTU)?”a dependable supporter of city Democrats and their political campaigns?”has consistently denounced voucher proposals. 

 In June 2013, CTU president Karen Lewis, a Democrat, attributed the failures of the Chicago Public Schools not to any shortcomings in the city's educational apparatus, but rather to the ?œfact that rich white people think they know what?™s in the best interest of children of African-Americans and Latinos, no matter what the parents??income or education level.???œIf you look at the majority of the tax base for property taxes in Chicago, they?™re mostly white, who don?™t have a real interest in paying for the education of poor black and brown children,??said Lewis. Citing the ?œpoverty and racism and inequality that hinders the delivery of an education product in our school system,??Lewis complained: ?œIt?™s as if there were a concerted effort to make sure that these are not walkable, thriving, healthy communities.??By Lewis's reckoning, vouchers would serve only to siphon much-needed funds away from the public schools, which presumably would be even more ineffective if they had to operate on anything less than their current $13,000-per-student. Notably, Lewis made no mention of the fact that Chicago's public school teachers are the highest-paid members of their profession in America, earning, on average, $76,000 per year.

 Following a pattern that is seen repeatedly in Democrat-controlled cities across the United States, the toxic brew of Chicago's high taxes, out-of-control crime rates, failing schools, mounting public debt, and anti-business economic climate has driven away massive numbers of residents and entrepreneurs. After the city's population peaked at 3.62 million in 1950, it underwent a half-century of decline that leveled off only temporarily in the 1990s. But immediately thereafter, some 200,000 people (including 175,000 African Americans) moved out of Chicago during the first decade of the 21st century?”an exodus exceeded in magnitude only by that of Detroit's former residents. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2010 Chicago's population stood at 2,695,598?”fewer than the 2.7 million who had lived there 90 years earlier.

All the rape, murder, corruption, unemployment, crime, and genocide can all be traced back to liberal ideas of forced desegration when blacks weren't ready, higher minimum wages, wealth redistribution, affirmative action, and the like. 

Human nature is immutable, but like water it can take different forms based on outside pressures. If the right factors come into play, Western Civilization could become like this.

SC Community Organizer Urges Black Youth To Be Angry, Racist","In the wake of the gruesome massacre of nine black churchgoers by an angry racist white gunman in Charleston, South Carolina, comes an article that encourages black youth to be angry, racist, uninformed, unforgiving, intentionally opaque, and to explicitly exclude and ignore ?œwhite folks??in a direct call for unrest","In the wake of the gruesome massacre of nine black churchgoers by an angry racist white gunman in Charleston, South Carolina, comes an article that encourages black youth to be angry, racist, uninformed, unforgiving, intentionally opaque, and to explicitly exclude and ignore ?œwhite folks??in a direct call for unrest and anarchy.
The most shocking part is that the call for uncivilized radical action comes not from some obscure underground revolutionary manifesto, but from an author with a conventional liberal resume, including a writing gig at the Huffington Post and a previous executive position with an ostensibly positive program working with black youth.
The article is called 8 Things Black Folk Don?™t Have to Do in Light of the AME Massacreand it?™s published on the website Black Youth Project. The suggestions of what ?œblack folk?don?™t have to do include forgive, ?œpolice our rage,???œbe peaceful,??or ?œexplain ourselves to anyone ??especially white folk.??The article also suggests youth avoid staying informed about news developments, with the author describing major media as a tool of the white man: ?œPersonally, I have not hate-watched any news coverage because I do not feel compelled to pad the pockets of white supremacist propaganda.??The battle cry for unbridled racist exclusion, uninformed anger, and actions, including the refusal to ?œgive up space,??shows how the radical agenda has become an acceptable part of public discourse in the Obama era.
A closer look at the author and her work also shows the disturbing connections between community organizing groups that paint themselves one way publicly, but seem to foster and promote a far different agenda when examined.
The author of ?? Things Black Folk Don?™t Have To Do?¦â€?is Arielle Newton, whoseLinkedIn resume says she attended Northeastern University studying political science and international affairs and lists her as the chief innovation officer and former ?œCivic Engagement Chair??at a group called Rockaway Youth Task Force, a 501(c)3 group.  Rockaway Youth confirmed that she left the group on January 20 of this year.
That group?™s website shows smiling black youth involved in the group?™s mission: ?œSince 2011, RYTF has engaged hundreds of local Rockaway youth between the ages of 15??5. RYTF?™s mission is cradled with our humble beginnings?”to empower local youth through civic engagement and volunteer opportunities. We build on our Four Principles: civic engagement, volunteer work, mentoring, and professional development.??



(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

That description sounds good: civic engagement and development are lofty and positive goals, which makes the racist suggestions by Ms. Newton all the more bizarre?¦that is, until you look into the Rockaway Youth Task Force.
The charity information website Guidestar has no information about the financials for the group, but the group?™s leader has a criminal record worthy of note.
Given Newton?™s call for anger, it?™s ironic that the Rockaway Youth Task Force?™s founder Milan Taylor had his own issues with rage. According to the website DNAInfo:
Milan Taylor, 25, allegedly threw the female victim, whose age was not released, on to a couch in the offices of the Rockaway Youth Task Force at 19-20 Mott Ave., near Beach 20th Street, on June 5, at around 8:30 p.m., according to the criminal complaint.
Taylor then placed his hand on the victim?™s neck and choked her, the complaint said.
Ultimately, Taylor pleaded to a lesser charge and was ordered to take eight weeks of anger management classes and given a restraining order. The victim, RiÃ¡na Sherwood, was upset by the plea deal:
Sherwood was also granted a full order of protection for one year against Taylor.
The victim, who said she is a co-founder of the group, said she has known Taylor for more than 10 years, during which time he exhibited ?œirrational behavior.??She did not elaborate.
To recap:
[ hana-code-insert ] 'Q1 300?250' is not found 
1) In the aftermath of Charleston, Arielle Newton wrote an article stating that black youth don?™t have to ?œjustify or police our rage,??because they ?œhave the right to feel and express our rage in a manner we deem appropriate.??She added only one qualification: ?œMy only ask is that Black folk aren?™t harmed by other Black folk.??2) Ms. Newton was an executive at an organization whose founder and CEO was required to take anger management classes for choking a woman.
Newton?™s article is a racist embarrassment?”something that would get any white writer fired and shunned if the races were reversed. One can only imagine the (justifiable) outrage if a white author with ties to a mainstream political group had issued the same call to action after, for example, the 1993 Long Island Railroad Massacre, when killer Colin Ferguson killed six and injured nineteen in a shooting of ?œblack rage.??Here?™s the post?”printed in its entirety under Fair Use?”to avoid any claims of ?œselective editing,??and because it needs to be read in full to be believed:
8 Things Black Folk Don?™t Have to Do in Light of the AME Massacre
By Arielle Newton
Justify or police our rage.
We have the right to feel and express our rage in a manner we deem appropriate. My only ask is that Black folk aren?™t harmed by other Black folk.
Apologize for our trauma or anger.
We do not need to further relinquish what little power we have. To anyone.
Stay informed of every update or development.
The triggers are real. If constantly being plugged in to this tragedy is causing mental, emotional, physical, and/or spiritual angst, it?™s okay to power down and step back. Personally, I have not hate-watched any news coverage because I do not feel compelled to pad the pockets of white supremacist propaganda.
Explain ourselves to anyone ??especially white folk.
Explanations given to those who don?™t agree or understand your analysis takes up entirely too much emotional space. Especially when these explanations are given to white people who are comfortable benefiting from a system that literally hates us.

Radio legend Rush Limbaugh, who has had issues with his weight over the years, is now mocking ?œtransracial??activist Rachel Dolezal by declaring a new physical identity for himself.
?œI think I?™m gonna identify as skinny,??Limbaugh said Tuesday. ?œThat way I will not have to ever go on a diet.??After giving it more thought during a commercial break, the host decided to make it official: ?œI officially today announced that I identify as skinny. From this day going forward, I am skinny.
?œNow, in the old days, people?™s reaction to that would be to call me delusional and maybe think I needed some help. Today, I?™m brave,??he continued. ?œIt?™s a courageous act to identify as skinny when one is not. I?™m sure I will get accolades all across Twitter and accolades all across Facebook, and accolades all across the Drive-By Media for positive thinking, now that I identify as skinny.???œAnd I?™m fully expecting that Weight Watchers and others will identify with me and welcome me to the fold as a skinny, since I now identify that way. The way I see myself is the way I am, not how you see me, and if you don?™t see me that way, you?™re the bigot. I?™m brave!??Rachel Dolezal, the now-famous former head of the Spokane, Washington, chapter of the NAACP, said during a Tuesday morning ?œToday??interview she still identifies as a black woman, despite the fact she was born white.
Host Matt Lauer asked Dolezal directly: ?œAre you an African-American???Dolezal?™s answer: ?œI identify as black,??she said.
Lauer then put up a photograph of Dolezal when she was 16 with pale white skin and blond hair and asked again about her self-identification as a black.
?œI would say that visibly, she would be identified as white by people who see her,??she said, speaking of herself in the third person while referring to the photo.
She also said that at the time of the photo, taken when she was 16 years old, she didn?™t self-identify as black. At the same time, Dolezal said she actually began to see herself as black when she was about five years old, when she selected brown rather than peach crayons to draw herself.
Lauer?™s question: ?œWhen did you start deceiving people and telling them you were black???Dolezal said she did ?œtake exception??to that terminology, ?œbecause it?™s a little more complex than me identifying as black,??she said.
Rather, the media actually opened the doors to the deception, she said, explaining how at first, newspapers referred to her as transracial, then biracial and finally, as black.
?œI never corrected that,??she admitted. ?œIt?™s more complex than being true or false in that particular instance.??Lauer: Because it helped you further your career ??because ?œit helped your meet your goals???Dolezal said she didn?™t ?œthink that?™s necessarily fair.??She also addressed the matter of Albert Wilkerson, the black man she falsely identified to friends as her father. Her biological parents, Ruthanne and Larry, are white.
?œHe actually approached me,??she said of Wilkerson, in response to Lauer?™s question about why she would claim a black father. ?œWe just connected on a very intimate level, as family. Albert Wilkerson is my dad. Every man can be a father, not every man can be a dad.??Dolezal also expressed few regrets for the actions she?™s taken that have come to light in recent days.
?œThere are probably a couple interviews I would deal a little differently with,??she said, ?œbut overall, my life has been one of survival and the decisions I?™ve made along the way ??have been to survive.??Dolezal resigned from her NAACP post earlier this week, as reported by WND, shortly after her parents outed her as white.
Earlier this month, in an apparent move to satirize former U.S. Olympic champion Bruce Jenner?™s transition from male to female, a caller to Limbaugh?™s program came out on the air as a black person trapped in a white man?™s body.
?œI?™m a little nervous ?™cause I?™ve never come out of the closet in any way before,??said 38-year-old Steve from Chillicothe, Missouri.
Listen to audio of Steve?™s call to Rush Limbaugh:
?œBut I wanted you to know, be the first to know and your audience to know that I am actually an African-American. I?™ve been an African-American my entire life. It?™s been bottled up inside me, and as of today, I?™m no longer going to be Caucasian.??Wondering how long Steve had been trapped in his ?œprison,??Limbaugh asked: ?œHow old were you when you first learned that you weren?™t really white???When Steve responded, ?œAbout 10,??Limbaugh then said: ?œTen years old, you knew you weren?™t white, even though you were. You weren?™t white, you knew you were African-American or black. So you?™ve lived 28 years in a prison, right? You haven?™t been able to be who you are????œRight,??said Steve. ?œIt?™s been horrible ?™cause every day I wake up and I know I?™m black and everyone around me is white, and I?™m living here in flyover country and everybody in my small town is basically white.??Limbaugh empathized with the caller, noting, ?œThis has to be hell because here you are, you?™re Caucasian, but you know you?™re black, but nobody can see that you?™re black, so nobody can see who you really are. ???œYou?™re desperate to be known for who you really are. You?™re not an actor. You want to be known for who you are. You know you?™re black, but nobody can tell it. And you go tell people you?™re black, and they think you?™re nuts, right????œRight,??responded Steve. ?œI mean, I?™ve signed up for, like, minority grants and that sort of thing, and, you know, they all just laugh at me.???œDo you hate the cops???Limbaugh asked. ?œDo you have an animus against police officers???Steve noted: ?œWell, that?™s been building lately, as I see how other people of my color treat the cops and feel toward them, that?™s kind of been building in me, so, yeah.??

7.9954E+14,Shaun King,799539910084929_1033031823402402,Shaun King: Devastating new study confirms the traumatic impact of Trump on America's children,"God, I?™m disturbed.

A recent survey of 2,000 K-12 school teachers nationwide confirmed our worst hunch ??the bigoted rise of Donald Trump is terrifying America?™s school children.

Here?™s a quick excerpt from the introduction on what they call ?œThe Trump Effect??

It?™s producing an alarming level of fear and anxiety among children of color and inflaming racial and ethnic tensions in the classroom. 

""Many students worry about being deported.

Other students have been emboldened by the divisive, often juvenile rhetoric in the campaign. Teachers have noted an increase in bullying, harassment and intimidation of students whose races, religions or nationalities have been the verbal targets of candidates on the campaign trail.

Educators are perplexed and conflicted about what to do. They report being stymied by the need to remain nonpartisan but disturbed by the anxiety in their classrooms and lessons that children may be absorbing from this campaign.""

Reporters here at the Daily News, meanwhile, have worked hard to track specific incidents:

A girl?™s soccer team in Wisconsin recently experienced white fans chanting Trump?™s name along with shouts of, ?œBuild the wall??while they played.

In February white fans at high school basketball games in Indiana and Iowa did the same thing to students of color.

Officials in Fairfax County, Virginia confirmed that white third graders there singled out and taunted a black student, telling him that he would be deported if Trump won the election.

All of these accounts are horrible, but the survey conducted by the Southern Poverty Law Center shows that we?™re not dealing with a few isolated incidents here or there, but a national trend.

According to the report:

**More than two-thirds of the teachers reported that students ??mainly immigrants, children of immigrants and Muslims ??have expressed concerns or fears about what might happen to them or their families after the election.

**More than half have seen an increase in uncivil political discourse.

**More than one-third have observed an increase in anti-Muslim or anti-immigrant sentiment.

**More than 40% are hesitant to teach about the election.

Those figures are staggering.

Even if they only represented the teachers who completed the survey ??and weren?™t representative of our entire country ??we?™re talking about thousands of students who have been harmed by the rise in bigotry brought on by the Trump campaign.

Nothing was as heartbreaking and revealing as the comments teachers made. The report states:

In Virginia, an elementary school teacher says students are ?œcrying in the classroom and having meltdowns at home.??
In Oregon, a teacher says her black students are ?œconcerned for their safety because of what they see on TV at Trump rallies.??
In North Carolina, a high school teacher says she has ?œLatino students who carry their birth certificates and Social Security cards to school because they are afraid they will be deported.??
In Tennessee, a kindergarten teacher says a Latino child ??told by classmates that he will be deported and trapped behind a wall ??asks every day, ?œIs the wall here yet???
It goes on:

Another teacher reports that a fifth-grader told a Muslim student ?œthat he was supporting Donald Trump because he was going to kill all of the Muslims if he became president!??All of this has the appearance to have happened suddenly, but that?™s a ruse. Indeed, Trump?™s rise to the top of the GOP polls is a new phenomenon, but the bigotry isn?™t new at all. It was lurking beneath the surface, deeply embedded into the fiber of this nation. Donald Trump, with his consistently bigoted statements, activated America?™s bigotry in ways that many of us simply didn?™t expect.

Consequently, from coast to coast, young children who had only heard about people being the target of bigotry at different times throughout history, are now experiencing it for themselves.

Even my own young children, who I like to think are politically savvy, are concerned. My son, EZ, who is 9, came home from school a few weeks ago and said his friends were worried that Trump might take us back to an ugly time in America?™s history.

He literally asked me if Trump could institute segregation or slavery again.

Can you imagine that stress on the mind of a child?

This is our America. 2016.

1.40254E+11,Tim Wise,140254320968_10153816113610969,,"So Donald Trump wants to bring ""stop-and-frisk,"" which he claims worked ""fantastically"" in NYC, to the entire nation...and this, as part of his black outreach initiative...aside from the bizarre tone-deafness, there are some things we should remember about Stop-and-frisk, which he conveniently ignores, all of which information is readily available from the court documents in the case;

1. From 2004-2012 there were 4.4 million stops, 2.3 million of which were followed up by a frisk.

2. In fewer than 1.5% of frisks was a weapon found (one of the key rationales given for the program).

3. This means that in only about 0.7% of stops did the person stopped have a weapon. 

4. Of these weapons (about 34,000 in all), only 4500 were guns. Thus, guns were found in only 0.1% of all stops.

5. Only 1.1% of stops resulted in other contraband like drugs being found

6. Overall, only 12 percent of persons stopped even received a summons/citation, let alone an arrest for some criminal offense. So 88 percent of persons stopped were entirely innocent of any wrongdoing. 

7. Even those summonsed were mostly given citations for public alcohol consumption or disorderly conduct. 

8. Nearly half of these summonses were ultimately dismissed or adjourned without findings of guilt (i.e., they were some bullshit -- technical legal term) 

9. 83% of all persons stopped were black or Latino

10. This disparity existed even though whites, when stopped, were actually slightly more likely to have drugs or guns on them than people of color.

11. Only about 15% of stops were the result of police investigating specific violent crimes. Most were for subjective causes like ""furtive movements"" or even simply because the persons stopped ""lived in a high crime area.""

12. The disproportionate stops of people of color were NOT justified by crime rate differences in the city. In fact, the racial composition of a precinct was a better predictor of who would be stopped than the crime rates in that precinct. According to the judge who found the practice unconstitutional: 

?œâ€¦blacks and Hispanics are more likely to be stopped than whites within precincts and census tracts, even after controlling for the racial composition, crime rate, patrol strength, and various socioeconomic characteristics of the precincts or census tracts where the stops take place. ??
13. The NYPD admitted it's purpose was to intimidate people of color. When a former member of the NYPD, and later a state senator, challenged Police Commissioner Kelly on the policy, he was told that the NYPD focused on young blacks and Latinos ?œbecause he wanted to instill fear in them, every time they leave their home, they could be stopped by the police.??
THIS is what Donald Trump supports. Unconstitutional, police-state tactics against people of color in the name of crime control.

White people don&#8217;t like black people therefore take down our nation&#8217;s flag? Nice try, Dude.","On Wednesday, the detestable Louis Farrakhan gave a speech before hundreds of people at the Metropolitan AME Church in Washington, D.C. I am sad that the folks at the AME church would invite a hatemonger and racist like Farrakhan to address them, but that is not the point of this article. The point is about what Farrakhan said while he was speaking to the crowd.
You can hear the relevant portions here at WMAL.
I?™ll hit some of the highlights for you ??check out some of his most provocative statements.
?œWe need to put the American flag down. Because we?™ve caught as much hell under that as the Confederate flag.???œWhat the hell is the use of us paying allegiance to a flag under which we get no justice????œWhite folks march with you because they don?™t want you upsetting the city, they don?™t give a damn about them nine.???œI don?™t know what the hell the fight is about over the Confederate flag. We need to put the American flag down. Because we?™ve caught as much hell under that as the Confederate flag.???œWho are we fighting today? It?™s the people that carry theAmerican flag.??Even sadder than the fact that the AME church allowed Farrakhan to speak was the fact that they folks in attendance applauded some of these most heinous comments.
I know that my words cannot assure these folks, but I want to say them anyway. I stand with the men and women of the Mother Emanuel AME church in Charleston, South Carolina. I would march with black Americans against injustice any time it reared its ugly head, and moreover, my heart breaks over the injustice African-Americans in the USA have faced and still face. Truly.
Whether or not Farrakhan and the people who listen to him can ever believe that ??there are many of us conservatives who wholeheartedly love them, even though we may disagree on politics and culture.

Wrong. Normalizing Trump is dangerous, because Trump isn?™t normal. And his presidency is unlikely to be ""just another conservative"" presidency. Consider: 

1. At every stage of the campaign ??when he officially declared his candidacy, when he became the presumptive nominee, and when he was elected -- we were told Trump would stop his hateful, lying rants. He still hasn?™t. Even as President-elect he?™s already tweeting vindictive lies about the New York Times and about the cast of ?œHamilton.??What happens when he has control over the IRS and FBI? 

2. His picks are already a Who?™s-Who of racist extremists. For Attorney General he wants Jeff Sessions ??a man who dismisses the Voting Rights Act, opposes immigration reform and sentencing reform, and whom a Republican Senate found unfit to be a federal judge because of racist statements and actions. 

3. For CIA director he?™s picked Mick Pampeo ??a Koch-brothers favorite who wants to expand secret surveillance of Americans and reopen ?œblack-site??torture centers, and hates the Iran nuclear deal.

4. For National Security Advisor he?™s picked Michael Flynn -- who says it?™s ?œrational??to fear Muslims, and that Islam is an ideology more than a religion. 

5. For chief strategist he?™s picked Stephen Bannon ??a man with a record of racist, misogynistic, and anti-Semitic publishing.

Warning: Don?™t be in denial. Trump is a clear and present danger to America and the world. Prepare yourself for the peaceful resistance. Now. (See my suggestions on this page.)

On this page, in a 10 part Facebook series, I am about to share all of the source links that are included in my post below for you to read and decide for yourself. 

https://www.facebook.com/shaunking/posts/1054593574579560","Many of you aren't religious, so please forgive me for recalling my roots as a preacher and starting us off with a simple verse of scripture.

""The love of money is the root of all kinds of evil.""

- 1 Timothy 6:10, The New Testament of the Bible

While my practice and devotion to religion has waxed and waned across the past few years, I still very much believe that verse is true. When you find evil in the world, when you find corruption, when you find starvation and exploitation, when you find poverty and despair, when you find drugs, guns, and substandard housing, when you find evil ??if you dig far enough, you will often discover the love of money at the root. Underneath so much of what is wrong in this country is the deep love of money and all that it brings. Sometimes the connection is obvious and undeniable - other times not so much, but like the huge glacier underneath the still water, it is there.

Right now, the Democratic Party, which I have called home my entire life, is deeply in love with money. Consequently, its leaders have supported and advanced all kinds of evil, big and small, in devotion to this love affair.

My sweet mother, who worked in a scorching hot light bulb factor for over 40 years of her life, introduced me to the party. While I'm not so sure it was ever really true, she taught me that Democrats were for the poor and working class of America. We waffled between those two groups ourselves, so for me, I chose to be a part of the party that represented us.

As a senior in high school, I attended my first political rally in 1996 as President Bill Clinton spoke at the University of Kentucky in his reelection bid. He was amazing.

In 1999, Atlanta's first black mayor, Maynard Jackson, who I loved and revered, recruited me to campaign for Al Gore and encouraged me to get involved with the party. As student government president at Morehouse College, I spoke at campaign events alongside Vice President Gore and his family and fought hard as hell for him to win. How he lost stung as much as the fact that he lost.

I had never lost an election or contest in my life. I was student government vice president in middle school. I was elected President of the Future Business Leader of America in high school. I was elected dorm president my freshman year of college and student government president for all of Morehouse the following year.

Seeing Al Gore lose was a bitter pill to swallow. Three years later, Maynard Jackson had a heart attack and died suddenly. With George W. Bush as President, Al Gore out of politics, and my political mentor dead, I bowed out and decided that party politics just wasn't my thing anymore.

For me, and I think for millions of Americans, that all changed when we first heard Barack Obama. As a preacher, I actually loved that Obama came from Jeremiah Wright's church in Chicago. Dr. Wright was a legend in the Afrocentric and activist circles I walked in. When I learned that Obama was a bi-racial former community organizer with two young daughters, I was sold. At that time, I had two young daughters, was doing community work, and grew up as the mixed kid who never quite fit in.

I volunteered for his campaign in Atlanta, attended rallies and events, phone-banked for him, and began writing regular op-eds about his candidacy. On the night he was elected, I was in tears and spoke live on NPR about how monumental it was.

The optimism, hope and dedication to change that Obama campaigned with was authentic. To prove it, his transition team introduced what were called the ""most far reaching ethics rules of any transition team in history.""

They effectively banned lobbyists and their money not only from his transition process, but also put in place a 12-month-ban on when they could serve in the administration after serving as a lobbyist.

Because he came into office with such momentum and a clear mandate, Obama also began to enforce similar restrictions on lobbyists with the DNC. If he could first change his administration, then change his party, he could change the entire game, he thought.

Did you know that Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was a co-chair of Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign against Obama, and is now the chair of the DNC, earlier this year did away with all of the restrictions on lobbyists that President Obama put in place?

According to the Washington Post,

""The DNC's recent, more sweeping reversal of the previous ban on donations from lobbyists and political action committees was confirmed by three Democratic lobbyists who said they have already received solicitations from the committee. The lobbyists requested anonymity to speak freely about the committee's decision, which has been otherwise kept quiet.""

Unless you are a political insider, it would be hard to know that such a thing had ever happened. No doubt, that was their goal. Why? Are they ashamed? It certainly appears so.

The article continued,

""For the most part, they (the lobbyists) said, the DNC has returned to business as usual, pre-2008. The DNC has even named a finance director specifically for PAC donations who has recently emailed prospective donors to let them know that they can now contribute again, according to an email that was reviewed by The Washington Post.""

Campaign watchdog groups were furious. This is a disgusting and unnecessary reversion, but it gives us a real clue into how the Democratic Party sincerely sees money in politics. They love it. They certainly didn't do this for Bernie Sanders. His campaign does not accept donations from SuperPACs or lobbyists and he's won 21 primaries and caucuses without it. The Clinton campaign, on the other hand, is awash in this type of money.

In essence, Hillary Clinton and the DNC each want us to believe that lobbyists and SuperPACs don't expect anything from them in return for their money. This is the most basic, foolish, offensive lie they could ever tell. Of course they want something in return. That's the business they're in.

On April 18, the Sanders campaign wrote an open letter declaring that Clinton's campaign was violating campaign finance laws through an unethical joint arrangement with the DNC. The Clinton campaign's response to that was that she was actually raising money for down-ticket Democrats. Two weeks later, though, Politico released an amazing investigative report which found that out of the $61 million the Clinton campaign they were raising for state parties, the parties were only allowed to keep 1% of it. You read that correctly. I'll spell it out so that you know a digit wasn't missing. They got to keep one percent of the funds she claimed she raised for them.

It appears to be a money laundering scheme. Do you remember when George Clooney said that Bernie Sanders and his supporters were right to be disgusted by the fact that some seats at the fundraiser cost $353,400 per couple, but that he could live with it because the money was mainly going to help smaller candidates win local elections?

He was wrong.

According to Politico, ""The victory fund has transferred $3.8 million to the state parties, but almost all of that cash ($3.3 million, or 88%) was quickly transferred (back) to the DNC, usually within a day or two, by the Clinton staffer who controls the committee, POLITICO's analysis of the FEC records found.""

Who really got the money? The Clinton campaign pocketed almost all of it and state parties were left with one penny on the dollar.

The Politico report continued, ""By contrast, the victory fund has transferred $15.4 million to Clinton's campaign and $5.7 million to the DNC, which will work closely with Clinton's campaign if and when she becomes the party's nominee. And most of the $23.3 million spent directly by the victory fund has gone toward expenses that appear to have directly benefited Clinton's campaign, including $2.8 million for ?˜salary and overhead??and $8.6 million for web advertising that mostly looks indistinguishable from Clinton campaign ads and that has helped Clinton build a network of small donors who will be critical in a general election expected to cost each side well in excess of $1 billion.""

Of course none of this is happenstance or coincidence. All of this is a well orchestrated plan. The American people are just now beginning to understand this ugliness. It's one of the primary reasons why 10 million people have voted for Bernie Sanders and why he has won 21 contests without even a smidgeon of support from the Democratic Party.

The thing is, though, the Democratic Party isn't really very democratic. It's sincerely just a machine for Hillary Clinton.

Van Jones, a former Obama administration official, said earlier this week on CNN, ""Debbie, who should be the umpire, who should be the marriage counselor, is coming in harder for Hillary Clinton than she is for herself. That is malpractice.""

""I wish Reince Priebus was my party chair. He did a better job of handling the Trump situation than I've see my party chair handle this situation,"" Jones said.

""I'm ashamed to say that. Yeah, I said it.""

Let that sink in for a minute. A man who has not endorsed a candidate, who worked for Obama, and is an award-winning leader said that he would rather the Republican Party chair be in charge of the DNC than Debbie Wasserman Schultz because of how hard she fights for Hillary Clinton. Forgive me for being repetitive, but please remember that Wasserman Schultz was a co-chair of Clinton's campaign in 2008. None of us should be surprised that she is so biased, but we should be disgusted that she is in charge of the entire party at a time when it required an unbiased presence.

I'll give it to her - Debbie Wasserman Schultz will say or do anything to get Hillary Clinton elected - even if it means completely ignoring the political reality that nearly half of the people who've voted in this primary have declared that they want to see lobbyists and SuperPACs out of politics. Her words and her deeds throughout this campaign have not only been unethical, but are out of step with the future of the party. Voters under the age of 45 prefer Bernie because they trust him and his principles. Wasserman Schultz and Clinton represent a brand of politics that they know well, but we're simply tired of it. Another op-ed was just released calling on her to be replaced.

Robert Reich, the famed economist who served as Labor Secretary under Bill Clinton, went so far on Thursday to suggest that a new party should be formed if Hillary wins the election.

Reich said, ?œNever, ever give up fighting against the increasing concentration of wealth and power at the top, which is undermining our democracy and distorting our economy. That means, if Hillary Clinton is elected, I urge you to turn Bernie's campaign into a movement - even a third party - to influence elections at the state level in 2018 and the presidency in 2020. No movement to change the allocation of power succeeds easily or quickly. We are in this for the long haul.??
Back in February, Michelle Alexander, the law professor and author of ?œThe New Jim Crow,??made a similar declaration. Her words struck me to my core.

?œThe biggest problem with Bernie, in the end, is that he's running as a Democrat ??as a member of a political party that not only capitulated to right-wing demagoguery but is now owned and controlled by a relatively small number of millionaires and billionaires,??she said.

?œYes, Sanders has raised millions from small donors, but should he become president, he would also become part of what he has otherwise derided as ?˜the establishment.??Even if Bernie's racial-justice views evolve, I hold little hope that a political revolution will occur within the Democratic Party without a sustained outside movement forcing truly transformational change. I am inclined to believe that it would be easier to build a new party than to save the Democratic Party from itself.""

I am in full agreement with both Reich and Alexander. Whatever happens between now and the Democratic Convention - what's next is that we form a brand new progressive political party from scratch. It has never been more clear to me that millions and millions of us do not belong in the Democratic Party. Their values are not our values. Their priorities are not our priorities. And I'll be honest with you, I think too highly of myself, of my family, of my friends, and of our future, to stick with a party that looks anything like what Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz are leading right now.

Clinton's refusal to release the transcripts of her speeches to Goldman Sachs was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. Her indignant and irrational excuses made no sense - particularly in light of the reports stating that the transcripts would ruin her campaign and made her sound like an executive at the company.

I'll start where I left off - the root of all of this is the love of money. In this campaign, Bernie Sanders, with a ragtag group of misfits, proved to the world that another way exists. He has created a blueprint for us on how we build a political movement without the money from billionaire class and their special interests.

In my heart, I believe we are on the brink of something very special. It isn't going to be the presidency of Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump either. It's going to be what those of us who've seen a better way do next.

Don't believe what anyone tells you - the ball is in our hand and we have more power than progressive people have had in a very long time in this country. I will fight for Bernie Sanders until he is no longer running for president.

After that, this will be my last election as a Democrat. I'm moving on and hope you do too.

Article by Dr. Mike Evans
When the topic of Jesus and the End Times is introduced, one would expect it to originate with Evangelical Christians. It is, rather, coming from ISIS. The music emanating from the flute of the ISIS snake charmer is prophecy, the End Times and Jesus.
The House of Islam, ISIS, has raised its black apocalyptic banner of the caliphate in Dabiq, Syria while awaiting the arrival of the ?œCrusader armies.??Recruits are joining from Tunisia, Russia, Jordan, Morocco, France, Turkey, Lebanon, Germany, Libya, the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, the Philippines, Somalia, Yemen, virtually the known world, and not surprisingly, from Saudi Arabia.
The birth process for ISIS has created and unleashed a Frankenstein-type monster. Its architects have totally lost control of the beast. Gulf State corporations, loosely called ?œcountries?? have employed oil-produced revenues to pay off Islamic fundamentalists, while extorting the more moderate Muslims in an attempt to keep the ogre at bay. ISIS claims that all emirate groups, states, and organizations are illegitimate, while it wants to conquer the world and usher in the final battle of the Apocalypse.
The ISIS appeal is for the purification of Islam. It considers all other branches of Islam to be apostate. No other movement has emphasized apocalyptism??the idea that civilization will soon come to a tumultuous end due to ISIS ties to Wahhabism which was birthed in Saudi Arabia and continues to flourish there. This sect believes that the arrival of the one known as the Mahdi is near. Of great significance to the ISIS horde is the large Syrian village of Dabiq.
An article in The Guardian newspaper clarified the prophecy:
The 1,300-year-old hadith, which is a report of the deeds, teachings and sayings of the Prophet Mohammed, refers to the 'horde' flying 80 banners as they take on a Muslim army in the Syrian town of Dabiq. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/??The-1-300-year-old-apocalyptic??It may seem more like fiction than reality, but the truth is: ISIS controls portions of Iraq and Syria, an area with a population of eight million. The lives of the inhabitants under ISIS control are a living hell. According to Bernard Haykel, a Princeton scholar, ?œSlavery, crucifixion, and beheadings are not something that freakish [jihadists] are cherry-picking from the medieval tradition. [They are] bringing it wholesale into the present day.??http://www.theatlantic.com/??03/what-isis-really-wa??384980/
Not only are Crusaders targeted, ISIS terrorists readily behead Muslims as was the case with 15-year old Ayham Hussein. He was caught in Mosul, Iraq by a faithful ISIS follower and held captive by other members of the death cult. Ayham was hauled before a sharia court, beaten and judged guilty. He was then dragged into the town square and beheaded. His crime: listening to Western music. No one is safe from the barbarism of ISIS.
With the capture of Dabiq, the Islamic State is living out its version of the Christian battle of Armageddon. Shockingly, over half of all Muslims in North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia are awaiting the imminent appearance of the Mahdi, the Islamic Messiah.
Its members believe the Day of Judgment will come only after Muslims defeat Rome?”the so-called Crusaders?”at Dabiq and Al-a?™maq, two villages near the Syrian border with Turkey. The Islamic State is so focused on the prophecy regarding Dabiq that it has given that name to its stylish, glossy, and artistically designed magazine. To maximize its reach, the publication is translated into a number of languages which include English.
Even more astounding, Isis teaches that Jesus will return to fight against the Crusaders alongside Muslims. As is written in the Bible, Jesus will return to take the faithful to heaven. Afterward, ISIS warriors believe they will hand their black flag to Jesus who will then join in the battle against Jews, Christians and the Antichrist?”the deceiver who claims to be the Messiah. This teaching is a huge selling-point in recruiting foreign jihadists to join the final battle of the Apocalypse.
Current political conditions in the post-Arab Spring climate, and especially in hypocritical, oil-rich, family-owned corporations called countries only feeds and fuels the narrative in the minds of the unemployed, impoverished youth. In the past countries such as Saudi Arabia could export terror and use social welfare and bribery to dumb-down the rhetoric being taught in mosques and madrassas by the mullahs. Now, thanks to the oil crisis, those dollars have disappeared.",,23/02/2016 00:00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7.9954E+14,Shaun King,799539910084929_1073524612686456,SHAUN KING: Deaths of Kendrick Johnson & Lennon Lacy are Legal Lynchings,"Have you heard of Kendrick Johnson or Lennon Lacy? Both were beloved black teenagers in predominantly white Southern towns who appear to their family and friends to have been lynched. Kendrick Johnson was found dead and disfigured, stuffed into a wrestling mat and Lennon Lacy hanging from a swing set in a strange pair of tennis shoes instead of the new Jordans he had just purchased.

This week, after investigations sparked in great part by protests and pleas from their families, the FBI said no charges will be filed against anyone.

The same determination was made about Otis Byrd last year when he was found hanging from a tree in Mississippi.

Perhaps all of this wouldn't be such a bitter pill to swallow if the conclusions were an anomaly. They aren't.

Between The Reconstruction of the 1870s and World War II, an astounding 4,075 African Americans were lynched in 12 Southern states. Then, as now, the idea of someone actually being held responsible for those 4,075 lynchings wasn't just far-fetched, it was non-existent.

Even in incidents where hundreds of African Americans were murdered by white mobs in East St. Louis, Tulsa, or Rosewood - not a single soul was held accountable. In fact, during the 82 year era of widespread lynching, only one man was truly held accountable - John S. Williams had murdered as many as 18 different black men that he had forcibly enslaved in the early 1900s and was sentenced to life in prison for it.

Sometimes, even when the evidence has been absolutely overwhelming, nobody would be held responsible for the lynchings of African-Americans.

In a gut wrenching report on lynching from the Equal Justice Initiative, the 1904 lynchings of Luther Holbert and his wife were described like this: ""Both victims were tied to a tree and forced to hold out their hands while members of the mob methodically chopped off their fingers and distributed them as souvenirs. Next, their ears were cut off.

?œMr. Holbert was then beaten so severely that his skull was fractured and one of his eyes was left hanging from its socket. Members of the mob used a large corkscrew to bore holes into the victims bodies and pull out large chunks of ?˜quivering flesh,??after which both victims were thrown onto a raging fire and burned. The white men, women, and children present watched the horrific murders while enjoying deviled eggs, lemonade, and whiskey in a picnic-like atmosphere.""

That may read like the worst horror movie of all time, but it is the gross history of this country. While crowds may no longer gather together in person to dine and celebrate the brutal lynchings of black folk, it happens virtually on social media in larger crowds than ever as hateful online mobs laugh and share memes and cruel jokes about black victims of racialized violence.

It's simply the modern manifestation of the same horrible spirit of cheerful violence surrounding black pain and death that ruled previous generations.

Eric Garner didn?™t kill himself.

Tamir Rice and John Crawford didn?™t kill themselves.

Rekia Boyd and Natasha McKenna didn't kill themselves.

But here we are again - they are dead and nobody is being held responsible. It doesn't seem to matter who investigates the deaths. The conclusions continue to be same tired version we've all heard before placing the blame on black folk for their own brutal demise.

That's the American way.

A Chicago police officer who was savagely beaten at a car accident scene this week did not draw her gun on her attacker ??even though she feared for her life ??because she was afraid of the media attention that would come if she shot him, the city?™s police chief said Thursday.

Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson said the officer, a 17-year veteran of the force, knew she should shoot the attacker but hesitated because ?œshe didn?™t want her family or the department to go through the scrutiny the next day on the national news,??the Chicago Tribune reported.

Johnson?™s remarks, which came at an awards ceremony for police and firefighters, underscore a point law enforcement officers and some political leaders have pressed repeatedly as crime has risen in Chicago and other major cities: that police are reluctant to use force or act aggressively because they worry about negative media attention that will follow.

The issue has become known as the Ferguson effect, named after the St. Louis suburb where a police officer shot and killed an unarmed black teenager in August 2014. The shooting set off protests and riots that summer and eventually gave way to a fevered national debate over race and policing. Many law enforcement officers have said that the intense focus on policing in the time since has put them on the defensive and hindered their work.

Criminologists are generally skeptical of the Ferguson effect, many arguing that there simply isn?™t enough evidence to definitively link spikes in crime to police acting with increased restraint. President Obama and Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch have also said not enough data exists to draw a clear connection.

In Chicago, which has experienced record numbers of homicides this year, Mayor Rahm Emanuel has blamed the surge in violent crime on officers balking during confrontations, saying they have become ?œfetal??because they don?™t want to be prosecuted or fired for their actions.
 
Chicago's gun violence is soaring amid a backdrop of poverty and an embattled police force. (Reuters)
Superintendent Johnson stopped short of saying the attack on the officer was an example of the Ferguson effect in action, but said being under a magnifying glass has caused his police to ?œsecond-guess??themselves.

According to Johnson, the 43-year-old officer, who has not been identified, was responding to a car crash Wednesday when a 28-year-old man who was involved in the accident struck her in the face, then repeatedly smashed her head against the pavement until she passed out. He said the attack went on for several minutes and that two others officers were injured as they tried to pull the suspect away, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. The suspect was on PCP, he said, and was finally subdued after officers Tasered and pepper sprayed him.

Johnson said he visited the officer in the hospital, where she told him why she did not draw her service weapon during the attack.

?œShe looked at me and said she thought she was going to die,??he told the audience at the awards ceremony. ?œAnd she knew that she should shoot this guy. But she chose not to because she didn?™t want her family or the department to have to go through the scrutiny the next day on national news.??
?œThis officer could [have] lost her life last night,??Johnson continued. ?œWe have to change the narrative of law enforcement across this country.??
The head of Chicago?™s police union, the largest in the country, said the incident showed just how concerned officers are about becoming the center of a public spectacle if they use force. Police ?œdon?™t want to become the next YouTube video,??he told the Tribune.

But a Chicago civil rights lawyer said that police bore some responsibility for the tension between police and the communities they serve. Decades of abuse by the police department had eroded the public?™s trust, attorney Jon Loevy told the Tribune.

?œAny fair-minded person acknowledges that police have a very difficult and dangerous job, and this sounds like a very unfortunate situation,??he said. ?œThe hope is that the department and the community can work to repair some of the lost trust so that officers won?™t always feel so second-guessed.??

I saw images of my daughter?™s face in gas chambers, with a smiling Trump in a Nazi uniform preparing to press a button and kill her. I saw her face photo-shopped into images of slaves. She was called a ?œniglet??and a ?œdindu.??The alt-right unleashed on my wife, Nancy, claiming that she had slept with black men while I was deployed to Iraq, and that I loved to watch while she had sex with ?œblack bucks.??People sent her pornographic images of black men having sex with white women, with someone photoshopped to look like me, watching.

I share my family?™s story not because we are unique or because our experience is all that extraordinary, but rather because it is depressingly, disturbingly ordinary this campaign season. The formula is simple: Criticize Trump ??especially his connection to the alt-right ??and the backlash will come.

Of course, no story would be complete without a truly ominous threat. The moment we landed back at home after I declined to run for president, she turned on her phone to see an e-mail from a Trump fan, a veteran who informed her that he knew the business end of a gun and told her directly that she should shut her mouth or he?™d take action.

Every campaign attracts its share of fools, cranks, and crazies. But Trump?™s candidacy has weaponized them. Every harassing tweet and every violent threat is like a voice whispering in my ear, telling me to do all that I can to oppose a movement that breeds and exploits such reckless hate.""",22/10/2016 00:00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7.9954E+14,Shaun King,799539910084929_1024262520945999,Shaun King: EMERGENCY: Mississippi just passed the most hateful anti-LGBT legislation in the country,"UPDATE: Today I am dedicating my social media exclusively to fighting Mississippi's HB 1523.

Conservatives in America are well known for what they hate.

They hate Obamacare. They can't explain why ??since it's pretty much just a website that sells health insurance ??but doggone it, they hate it.

Ben Carson said it's the worst thing to happen to America since slavery ??and since he's a brain doctor, it must be true.

They hate gay marriage. Every election cycle for a few decades they've kicked gay marriage around like a political football to drum up votes. It's been pretty effective, but now it's the law of the land.

Now, in states all over the south, politicians need something and somebody to hate to help rally their troops. In previous generations, it was black folk. While that hate still exists in various forms, it's no longer easy to use it for political gain.

So, the hateful flavors of 2016 happen to be Mexican immigrants, Syrian refugees, and the LGBT community.

Last week, in one whirlwind day, North Carolina proposed, passed and signed into law, with the help of Republican Gov. Pat McCrory, what many have called the harshest anti-LGBT law in the nation.

Clearly, Mississippi didn't want to be out-bigoted by their comrades in North Carolina. By a margin of 31-17, they have now passed what is indisputably the most bigoted, hateful anti-LGBT bill in the country. House Bill 1523 is 13 pages of ugly. Not surprisingly, the Governor, Phil Bryant thinks otherwise and is expected to sign it as soon as today.

Not only does the bill allow religious organizations, charities and some businesses to openly refuse services to LGBT individuals it also allows people in the state to openly deny basic human rights to transgender individuals.

As long as those denying these human rights say they're doing so because of ""sincerely held religious beliefs,"" in Mississippi they'll be fine if the bill becomes law.

It's not just about churches ??this bill protects those providing photography, poetry, videography, disc-jockey services, wedding planning, printing, floral arrangements, dress making, cake or pastry, artistry, wedding-venue rentals, limousine, car-service rentals, jewelry sales and services, or similar marriage-related services.

It also protects doctors, counselors, fertility clinics, those with restrooms, dressing rooms, showers or locker rooms, and a litany of other individuals and businesses if they refuse services to LGBT individuals based on their religious beliefs.

The bill is ugly. Anybody saying it isn't is either lying or ignorant to what it really means to the people it will impact the most.

Now the bottom line is this ??this bill is being proposed now because nothing rallies the conservative base before a presidential election like some good old fashioned hate. They can claim this is being done in the name of Jesus Christ all they want, but the notion that Christians want the right to refuse service to anyone based on their religion is as fundamentally un-Christian as a policy could ever.

I am a Christian. The Jesus I know surrounded himself and served people that were marginalized and hated by society. Passing this hate off as Christian is spitting in the face of the most basic precepts of the faith ??like doing unto others as you would have them do unto you.

With every week that passes, it is clear that bigotry in America is becoming mainstreamed again.

""Facebook workers routinely suppressed news stories of interest to conservative readers from the social network?™s influential ?œtrending??news section, according to a former journalist who worked on the project. This individual says that workers prevented stories about the right-wing CPAC gathering, Mitt Romney, Rand Paul, and other conservative topics from appearing in the highly-influential section, even though they were organically trending among the site?™s users.

""Several former Facebook ?œnews curators,??as they were known internally, also told Gizmodo that they were instructed to artificially ?œinject??selected stories into the trending news module, even if they weren?™t popular enough to warrant inclusion?”or in some cases weren?™t trending at all. The former curators, all of whom worked as contractors, also said they were directed not to include news about Facebook itself in the trending module.

In other words, Facebook?™s news section operates like a traditional newsroom, reflecting the biases of its workers and the institutional imperatives of the corporation. Imposing human editorial values onto the lists of topics an algorithm spits out is by no means a bad thing?”but it is in stark contrast to the company?™s claims that the trending module simply lists ?œtopics that have recently become popular on Facebook.??
These new allegations emerged after Gizmodo last week revealed details about the inner workings of Facebook?™s trending news team?”a small group of young journalists, primarily educated at Ivy League or private East Coast universities, who curate the ?œtrending??module on the upper-right-hand corner of the site. As we reported last week, curators have access to a ranked list of trending topics surfaced by Facebook?™s algorithm, which prioritizes the stories that should be shown to Facebook users in the trending section. The curators write headlines and summaries of each topic, and include links to news sites. The section, which launched in 2014, constitutes some of the most powerful real estate on the internet and helps dictate what news Facebook?™s users??67 million in the US alone?”are reading at any given moment.

?œI believe it had a chilling effect on conservative news.???œDepending on who was on shift, things would be blacklisted or trending,??said the former curator. This individual asked to remain anonymous, citing fear of retribution from the company. The former curator is politically conservative, one of a very small handful of curators with such views on the trending team. ?œI?™d come on shift and I?™d discover that CPAC or Mitt Romney or Glenn Beck or popular conservative topics wouldn?™t be trending because either the curator didn?™t recognize the news topic or it was like they had a bias against Ted Cruz.??
""The former curator was so troubled by the omissions that they kept a running log of them at the time; this individual provided the notes to Gizmodo. Among the deep-sixed or suppressed topics on the list: former IRS official Lois Lerner, who was accused by Republicans of inappropriately scrutinizing conservative groups; Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker; popular conservative news aggregator the Drudge Report; Chris Kyle, the former Navy SEAL who was murdered in 2013; and former Fox News contributor Steven Crowder. ?œI believe it had a chilling effect on conservative news,??the former curator said.""

Gun Crimes Soar In Democrat-Controlled Cities,"On July 9, USA Today ran a column focused on soaring gun crime in Baltimore, Chicago, Milwaukee, New Orleans, and St. Louis. The common denominator in all five cities??”decades of Democrat mayoral leadership.
The Mayor of Baltimore is Stephanie-Rawlings Blake (D), Mayor of Chicago is Rahm Emanuel (D), Mayor of Milwaukee is","On July 9, USA Today ran a column focused on soaring gun crime in Baltimore, Chicago, Milwaukee, New Orleans, and St. Louis. The common denominator in all five cities??”decades of Democrat mayoral leadership.
The Mayor of Baltimore is Stephanie-Rawlings Blake (D), Mayor of Chicago is Rahm Emanuel (D), Mayor of Milwaukee is Tom Barrett (D), Mayor of New Orleans is Mitch Landrieu (D), and Mayor of St. Louis is Francis G. Slay (D). And these mayors are not simply Democrats, but Democrats who succeeded Democrats before them, which in every case succeeded Democrats as well.
And what is happening in these cities now? Gun crime is soaring. And not in the suburbs where one is less apt to find Democrat voters, but in the ?œpoor and predominantly African-American and Latino neighborhoods?â€”the very neighborhoods to whom Democrats appeal each election cycle with talk of change, promises of more benefits, and plans to crackdown on crime via gun control.
Yet things do not look as good in reality as they looked on paper. USA Today reports the ?œnumber of murders in 2015 jumped by 33% or more in Baltimore, New Orleans and St. Louis,??and in Chicago ?œthe homicide toll climbed 19% and the number of shooting incidents increased by 21% during the first half of the year.??In Milwaukee, Police Chief Edward Flynn indicates ?œthe sound of gunfire is so commonplace that about 80% of gunshots detected by ShotSpotter sensors aren?™t even called into police by residents.??What is the response to the soaring crime in ?œpoor and predominantly African-American and Latino neighborhoods??in these cities? Calls for more gun control, of course.
For example, in January, KSDK reported that St. Louis Mayor Slay blamed violence in his city on ?œlax gun laws in the state [that] make it painfully easy to get a gun, carry a gun and get off on charges when someone is arrested with a gun.??He worked with state representative Stacey Newman (D-Dist. 087) who then pushed expanded background checks and a bill to make it easier for police to confiscate guns.
On March 9, Fox 6 reported that Milwaukee Mayor Barrett used his State of the City to suggest it is too easy to get a concealed permit and to ?œchallenge the state Legislature to do more when it comes to gun control.??And Mayor Emanuel has repeatedly pushed more gun control as a solution for failed gun control in Chicago. After a 2015 Memorial Day Weekend during which 12 people were shot and killed and 43 more were wounded, Emanuel called for more gun control. CBS Chicagoreported that Emanuel made this push at a May 26 luncheon in which he called for ?œstronger gun laws.??He said, ?œIt is not just about how many police you have, it is about the quantity of guns that are on the street so we actually have gun laws that back up the men and women we just recognized.??Speaking of how many ?œpolice you have,??Democrat-run Detroit isn?™t even fielding a full team anymore. According to CBS Detroit, there are 719,777 residents in Detroit and only ??,590 police officers.??The bright spot in the middle of all this is Detroit Police Chief James Craig?™s clear and fervent support for citizens arming themselves for defense of self and property.
The bottom line, for now, is that these Democrat-run cities are violent. And their violence is of a sort that gun control can?™t fix because control only affects law-abiding citizens. To respond to this kind of crime with laws that force law-abiding citizens to jump through more hoops to get guns is only to put law-abiding citizens in a place where defending themselves becomes more and more difficult.

These were the fond memories and lessons Angela took to the grave site with her every day for a week after the funeral. She would stand over her dear mother?™s grave and read letters aloud to express how much she missed her. Each message was filled with deep emotion and heartache. It was Angela?™s way of dealing with the anxiety and pain of losing her number one role model and her best friend. On the last night before she was preparing to leave for Atlanta, Angela locked herself in her mother?™s bedroom and prayed to God for guidance. Bright and early the following morning she wrote her final letter and then went to the grave site to deliver it to her mother.

Dear Mama,

I know you?™re tired of listening to all these sad letters. I?™ve been out here every day in the cold and rain just to read to you and have you all to myself. If I know you, you?™re probably lookÂ­ing down from heaven thinking, ?œThat child has lost her mind.??But the fact is that I miss you, Mama. I miss you so much that sometimes I don?™t think I?™m going to be able to make it. Every day I wake up hoping that all of this is just some kind of horrible dream, and that you?™re going to come into my room and tell me to get my lazy behind out of bed so we can go shopping. For a brief moment I?™m happy, and everything is the way it used to be. But after I get up and go into your empty bedroom, reality sets in; my whole world comes tumbling down around me. When that happens, nothing matters to me: not school, not my career, not even food. Look at me, I?™ve lost nearly fifteen pounds in the last two weeks; and I?™m as thin as a rail. I guess I can finally be a supermodel after all.

I?™m making fun because I woke up this morning with God?™s comforting arms wrapped around me. He told me everything was going to be all right and that it was time for me to get on with my life. That?™s when I sprang out of bed and took inventory of myself. I realized that I am the daughter of Ms. Faye Williams, a strong black woman who went through hell and high water to give her children a chance to make something of themselves in this cold world. I had to check myself, Mama, because you had to endure trials and tribulations ten times worse than death, and you made it. I was first embarrassed and then ashamed of myself for not being stronger for you and for Andre. But I want you to know that I?™m okay now, and with God?™s help I?™m ready to move forward with my life and honor your name. My only wish is that I will grow up to be half the woman that you were. I love you, Mama.

Rest in peace.
Your loving daughter,
Angela

1.53081E+11,Donald J. Trump,153080620724_10157510424610725,,"It?™s so great to be here tonight.  I am honored to also be joined this evening by Governor Scott Walker, Chairman Reince Prebius, and Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

We are at a decisive moment in this election.  Last week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country.  Yesterday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.  Tonight, I am going to talk about how to make our communities safe again from crime and lawlessness.

Let me begin by thanking the law enforcement officers here in this city, and across this country, for their service and sacrifice in difficult times.  The violence, riots and destruction that have taken place in Milwaukee is an assault on the right of all citizens to live in security and peace.  Law and order must be restored. It must be restored for the sake of all, but most especially the sake of those living in the affected communities.

The main victims of these riots are law-abiding African-American citizens living in these neighborhoods.  It is their jobs, their homes, their schools and communities which will suffer as a result.
There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct.  Crime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration.

The narrative that has been pushed aggressively for years now by our current Administration, and pushed by my opponent Hillary Clinton, is a false one.  The problem in our poorest communities is not that there are too many police, the problem is that there are not enough police.  

More law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing is what our country needs.
Just like Hillary Clinton is against the miners, she is against the police. You know it, and I know it.

Those peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society ??a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent ??share directly in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee, and many other places within our country.

They have fostered the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America.  Everytime we rush to judgment with false facts and narratives ??whether in Ferguson or in Baltimore ??and foment further unrest, we do a direct disservice to poor African-American residents who are hurt by the high crime in their communities.

During the last 72 hours, while protestors have raged against the police here in Milwaukee, another 9 were killed in Chicago and another 46 were wounded.  More than 2,600 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year, and almost 4,000 killed in President Obama?™s hometown area since his presidency began.
How are we serving these American victims by attacking law enforcement officers?

The war on our police must end.  It must end now!

The war on our police is a war on all peaceful citizens who want to be able to work and live and send their kids to school in safety.  
Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the rioter, the looter, the violent disruptor.  Our job is to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent who wants their kids to be able to safely walk the streets.  Or the senior citizen waiting for a bus.  Or the young child walking home from school.  For every one violent protestor, there are a hundred of moms and dads and kids on that same city block who just want to be able to sleep safely at night.  My opponent would rather protect the offender than the victim.

Hillary Clinton-backed policies are responsible for the problems in the inner cities today, and a vote for her is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime, and lost opportunities. 
I care too much about my country to let that happen.  
We all care too much about our country to let that happen.
Good policing saves lives.  

My dear friend, Rudy Giuliani, knows a thing or two about this.  The policies put into place by Rudy ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent.  Think of how many families were saved, how much heartache was prevented, when police were put into communities and criminals were removed.

Imagine how many lives could have been saved, all across this country, if Democratic politicians hadn?™t blocked in their cities what Rudy did in New York City?  I?™ll make sure we deliver safe neighborhoods here in Milwaukee, and all across this country.
It?™s easy for Hillary Clinton to turn a blind eye to crime when she has her own private security force.  I believe all Americans, not just the powerful, are entitled to security.

Hillary Clinton has had her chance.  She failed.  Now it?™s time for new leadership. The Hillary Clinton agenda hurts poor people the most.

There is no compassion in allowing drug dealers, gang members, and felons to prey on innocent people.  It is the first duty of government to keep the innocent safe, and when I am President I will fight for the safety of every American ??and especially those Americans who have not known safety for a very, very long time.
I am asking for the vote of every African-American citizen struggling in our country today who wants a different future.

It is time for our society to address some honest and very difficult truths.  The Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community.  Democratic crime policies, education policies, and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes, and more poverty.

Let us look at the situation right here in Milwaukee, a city run by Democrats for decade after decade.  Last year, killings in this city increased by 69 percent, plus another 634 victims of non-fatal shootings.  18-29-year-olds accounted for nearly half of the homicide victims.  The poverty rate here is nearly double the national average.  Almost 4 in 10 African-American men in Milwaukee between the ages of 25-54 do not have a job.  Nearly Four in 10 single mother households are living in poverty.  55 public schools in this city have been rated as failing to meet expectations, despite ten thousand dollars in funding per-pupil. There is only a 60% graduation rate, and it?™s one of the worst public school systems in the country.

1 in 5 manufacturing jobs has disappeared in Milwaukee since we fully opened our markets to China, and many African-American neighborhoods have borne the brunt of this hit.

To every voter in Milwaukee, to every voter living in every inner city, or every forgotten stretch of our society, I am running to offer you a better future. 

The Democratic Party has taken the votes of African-Americans for granted.  They?™ve just assumed they?™ll get your support and done nothing in return for it.  It?™s time to give the Democrats some competition for these votes, and it?™s time to rebuild the inner cities of America ??and to reject the failed leadership of a rigged political system.

I?™m not part of the corrupt system. In fact, the corrupt system is trying to stop me.  I?™ve been paying my own way.  The voters in the Republican Party this year defied the donors, the consultants, the power brokers, and choose a nominee from outside our failed and corrupt and broken system.  

The other party ??the Democratic Party ??nominated the personification of special interest corruption.  The Democratic Party rigged the nomination to give it to Hillary Clinton, thus giving the soul of their party this year to the special interests.

I am running to listen to your voice, to hear your cries for help.  The quiet voices in our society, not the loudest demonstrators, need to have their demands heard.

Jobs. Safety. Opportunity. Fair and equal representation. 
We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton which panders to and talks down to communities of color and sees them only as votes, not as individual human beings worthy of a better future.  She doesn?™t care at all about the hurting people of this country, or the suffering she has caused them.

The African-American community has been taken for granted for decades by the Democratic Party.  It?™s time to break with the failures of the past ??I want to offer Americans a new future.
It is time for rule by the people, not rule by special interests.

Every insider, getting rich off of our broken system, is throwing money at Hillary Clinton.  The hedge fund managers, the Wall Street investors, the professional political class.  

It?™s the powerful protecting the powerful.

Insiders fighting for insiders.  

I am fighting for you!

When we talk about the insider, who are we talking about?  It?™s the comfortable politicians looking out for their own interests.  It?™s the lobbyists who know how to insert that perfect loophole into every bill.  It?™s the financial industry knows how to regulate their competition out of existence.  The insiders also include the media executives, anchors and journalists in Washington, Los Angeles, and New York City, who are part of the same failed status quo and want nothing to change.

Every day you pick up a newspaper, or turn on the nightly news, and hear about how some banker or some Washington insider says they oppose our campaign.  Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign.  Or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign.

I wear their opposition as a badge of honor.  Because it means I am fighting for REAL change, not just partisan change.  I am fighting ??all of us across the country are fighting ??for peaceful regime change in our own country.  The media-donor-political complex that?™s bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.

The leadership class in Washington D.C., of which Hillary Clinton has been a member for thirty years, has abandoned the people of this country.

I am going to give the people their voice back.
Think about it.  The people opposing our campaign are the same people who have left our border open and let innocent people suffer as a result.

The people opposing our campaign are the same people who have led us into one disastrous foreign war after another.
The people opposing our campaign are the same people who lied to us about one trade deal after another.

Aren?™t you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?

Aren?™t you tired of big media, big businesses, and big donors rigging the system to keep your voice from being heard?

Are you ready for change?

Are you ready for leadership that puts you, the American people, first? That puts your country first? That puts your family first?
Let?™s talk about what this means for the inner cities of America.  

It?™s time to break through the television noise, the entrenched interests.  I understand that a lot of powerful people in our political system ??a lot of people who?™ve created our problems ??will lose a lot of their contracts, and their special gigs, if African-American voters, and all minority voters, support my campaign.
  
It?™s time to stop making the special interests rich.  It?™s time to make the American people rich.

I am going to Make America Wealthy Again.

The Democratic Party has run every inner city in this country for 50 years, and run them into financial ruin.

They?™ve ruined the schools. 

They?™ve driven out the jobs.

They?™ve tolerated a level of crime no American should consider acceptable.

Violent crime has risen 17% in America?™s 50 largest cities last year.  Killings of police officers this year is up nearly 50 percent.  Homicides are up more than 60% in Baltimore. They are up more than 50% in Washington, D.C.  

This is future offered by Hillary Clinton. More poverty, more crime, and more of the same.  The future she offers is the most pessimistic thing I can possibly imagine.  It is time for a different future. 

Here is what I am proposing.

First, on immigration.  No community in this country has been hurt worse by Hillary Clinton?™s immigration policies than the African-American community.  Now she is proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants, taking jobs directly from low-income Americans.  I will secure our border, protect our workers, and improve jobs and wages in your community. We will only invite people to join our country who share our tolerant values, who support our Constitution, and who love all of our people.

On trade, I am going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, withdraw from the TPP, and protect every last American job.
On taxes, I am going to give a massive tax cut to every worker and small business in this country, bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs onto our shores ??and make it very difficult for our businesses to leave.  I am going to reform our regulations so jobs stay in America, and new businesses come to America to hire workers right here in Milwaukee.  Every policy my opponent has sends jobs overseas. I am going to bring trillions in new wealth back to the United States.

On education, it is time to have school choice, merit pay for teachers, and to end the tenure policies that hurt good teachers and reward bad teachers. We are going to put students and parents first.  
Hillary Clinton would deny opportunities to millions of young African-American children, just so she can curry favor with the education bureaucracy.  I am going to allow charter schools to thrive, and help young kids get on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a good-paying job.

On crime, I am going to support more police in our communities, appoint the best prosecutors and judges in the country, pursue strong enforcement of federal laws, and I am going to break up the gangs, the cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our neighborhoods.  To every lawbreaker hurting innocent people in this country, I say: your free reign will soon come crashing to an end.

On healthcare, we are going to get rid of Obamacare ??which has caused soaring double-digit premium increases ??and give choice to patients and consumers.  Aetna, just today, announced they are dropping out ??as are many of the major insurance companies.

On government corruption, I am going to restore honor to our government.  We?™ve seen the corruption of Hillary Clinton, the mass email deletions, the pay-for-play at the State Department, the profiteering, the favors given to foreign corporations and governments at your expense.  We?™ve seen a former Secretary of State lie to Congress about her illegal email scheme, risk innocent American lives, and bring dishonor onto our government.
In my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information.  No one will be above the law.
I am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.

I am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government. This is all just the beginning.

We are going to make this a government of the people once again.  This is our chance to take back power from all the people who?™ve taken it from you.  The reason you see the establishment media lining up behind my opponent is because they are scared that you, with your vote, can take away their power and return it to your family and community.

These are tough times.  But I know we can make American Greater Than Ever Before.  To do this, we are going to need a fighter in the White House.  I will be your fighter.

To defeat crime and Radical Islamic Terrorism in our country, to win trade in our country, you need tremendous physical and mental strength and stamina.  Hillary Clinton doesn?™t have that strength and stamina.  She cannot win for you.

Most importantly, she has bad judgment.  Bad judgment on terrorism, bad judgement on foreign policy, bad judgment on trade.  
The only individuals she?™s ever delivered for is her donors ??not the people.

I?™ve said it before, and I?™ll say it again.  My opponent asks her supporters to repeat three-word pledge.  

Her pledge reads: ?œI?™m With Her.""  I choose to recite a different pledge.  My pledge reads: ?œI?™m With You ??the American people.??
I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally.  We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity ??a future built on our common culture and values as one American people.

I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.  We will once again be a country of law and order, and a country of great success.

To every parent who dreams for their children, and to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I?™m with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.

Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.

We Will Make American Safe Again.  And We Will Make America Great Again.  

Thank you, and God Bless,
Donald J. Trump",,16/08/2016 00:00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""The shooting looked bad. But that is when the professor is at his best. A black motorist, pulled to the side of the road for a turn-signal violation, had stuffed his hand into his pocket. The white officer yelled for him to take it out. When the driver started to comply, the officer shot him dead.

""The driver was unarmed.

""A group of young black men were incorrectly arrested on suspicion of firearm possession during a protest in Ferguson, Missouri, as a group of white militiamen, armed with rifles and wearing body armour and camouflage claimed they were granted permission to walk through the protests by police officers...

""On Monday night, a group of at least three black men who were standing by a car next to a hair salon on West Florissant Avenue were arrested after a phalanx of St Louis County police surged towards them, using pepper spray and batons. A spokesman for police department told the Guardian by email on Tuesday that officers had received information 'that the occupants or folks near that vehicle were possibly armed with handguns.'

""But the spokesman later confirmed that none of those arrested during the swoop were in possession of any weapons.

""The treatment of these suspects, who were wrestled to the ground and placed in plastic flexicuffs, came in seemingly stark contrast to a group of white militiamen, who arrived at the protest at around 1am, after the arrests occurred, carrying loaded M-15 rifles with several magazine cartridges strapped across their body armour.

""The men belonged to a group named the Oath Keepers, a collective of former and current military servicemen and police officers who claim to defend the US constitution 'against all enemies, foreign and domestic.' The group is described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a 'fiercely anti-government, militaristic group.'""

Don&#8217;t let the government take away our second amendment right!,"In the aftermath of the Charleston, South Carolina terrorism against churchgoers at a historical black church, many African Americans have decided that the they cannot rely on the police for protection.
President Obama tried to make the act of terrorism by Dylann Storm Roof about ?œgun control,??but more and more, Black Media is taking notice and not having it.
The Atlanta Black Star ran a piece entitled ?œObama Makes Charleston Shooting About Gun Control Instead of Terrorism Against Black People??which asserted the president was out of touch with what was actually going on.
African American gun ownership and support for carrying firearms for self-defense is at an all time high.
An African American church in Minneapolis says they will act as their own security guards and carry guns due to past threats directed towards the congregation. They say they can?™t count on the police to protect them from incidences like what happened Wednesday night in Charleston, South Carolina.
NPR reports an interesting anecdote that illustrates this shift??When James Craig was a young man in the 1970s, he says law-abiding people wouldn?™t dream of carrying guns. But then he left town to pursue a career in policing. In the years he was gone, Michigan liberalized its gun laws, making it easier for people to get concealed-carry permits.
When he came back to become Detroit?™s police chief in 2013, he found a whole new reality.
?œYou would have thought, given the dynamic of people who carry weapons, that we were maybe in Texas,??he says. ?œBut in fact, we were in Detroit, Michigan!??Police chiefs usually don?™t like the idea of citizens carrying concealed guns for self-defense, but Craig says he had to be realistic about the situation in his hometown.
That?™s right, even the police chief in Detroit had changed his tune about people arming themselves.
?œIt was a well-known fact here in Detroit,??he explained. ?œPeople didn?™t have a lot of confidence that when they dialed 911, that the police were going to show up. In fact, we know they didn?™t.??According the Pew Research Center, 54% of African Americans now view gun ownership as a good thing.
When asked specifically, those surveyed said that owning a gun was more likely to result protection than harm.
Just two years ago that was at 29%.
But many in the community say that it African Americans are being ?œhunted??and that ?œself-defense is the only defense.??As well, with the high profile police shootings of unarmed and otherwise-innocent African Americans by law enforcement officers, many in the community do not feel safe calling the police for protection.
At a historically black church, Greater St. Matthew Baptist, Pastor David Bullock notes that there are pews where armed congregants usually sit.

This Is Not, Nor Has It Ever Been About Truth Or Facts

The Republican/Tea Party/Right-wing mission is to tear down the President and First Lady on every level. They seek not just to undermine, but demonize them. Their goal... To taint their time in the White House in such a grievous way that voters would not soon again elect a black President.

Fact: George W Bush was not elected by the voters he was placed in office by Right-wing judges. 
Yet not a single Republican challenged his legitimacy. Nor did they complain about activist judges.

Fact: Bush personally received numerous warnings regarding Al Qaeda and did nothing. 
Yet no Republicans called him weak or incompetent. 

Fact: G. W. Was an intellectual lightweight committing verbal stumbles regularly along with countless acts of buffoonery.
Yet Republicans did not demand to see his college grades.

Fact: Bush, Cheney, Rice, Rumsfeld and their entire administration told bald faced lies to the American people.
Yet no Republican calls for Impeachment and no one yelled ?œyou lie??during any of his State of the Union addresses. 

Fact: Obesity is an epidemic in this country. 1 in every 3 American kids are obese. 
Yet the Right-wing attacked the first lady for emphasizing healthy eating habits and exercise. She has been called uppity and angry black woman. They have even insulted her physical appearance. 

Facts: The Bush/Cheney scandals include Halliburton Blackwater, Ennron, Valerie Plame, countless No Bid Contract giveaways, and 12 billion dollars in cash that vanished. 
Yet no outrage or calls for hearings from the very same people who now relentlessly ride President Obama's back. 

President Obama ran on a platform of Hope and Change the two things the Right-wing fear most. This mudslide they have unleashed on the First Family is about stamping out that Hope and reversing that Change. But we see them for who and what they truly are. And we recognize the despicable game they are playing. The key to dealing with them is understanding that there is no dept to which they will not sink. The time for niceties has past. We must loudly, boldly and in no uncertain terms call them out on their BS. This goes not only for Republicans & Tea Partiers, but Democrats and members of the media who continue to let these liars go unchallenged.

Despite the stereotypes about pro lifers, this was also a diverse crowd. Young, old, men, women, black, white. Turns out all types of people oppose baby murder.

I only wish the crowd was larger. There should be 10 thousand people out here. The streets should be lined for blocks. If everyone who says they oppose the murder of infants put that belief into action, I believe abortion would be outlawed in less than a year.

Let's look at this as a new start. A first step. Millions of us hate abortion with a passion, but now let's all move to DO something with that passion. 

This could be the beginning of the end for Planned Parenthood, but we need to be relentless, or this will all fade into the background and everything will continue on as normal.

54172246106,Rand Paul,54172246106_10153972526236107,Committee to Elect Darryl Glenn,,"I am deeply grieved about what we have seen this past week. Words are hard to find. 

What happened in Minnesota, Dallas, and Baton Rouge was unspeakably evil. It is impossible to watch what has taken place in these three cities without feeling a mixture of grief and anger.

With tragedy like this unfolding around us, we need to hold in our head two distinct thoughts at the same time: You can support and be grateful for your police and at the same find the actions of certain individual police abhorrent. In the same way, if a pastor or priest violates the trust of his flock, it does not mean you do not love your church. But it does mean there?™s a serious violation of trust. Justice must be brought to that person. Because when the people who are supposed to protect us violate our trust, it erodes our trust in each other and our faith in the rule of law. 

Likewise, finding the actions of individual police abhorrent does not mean we have the right to disrespect police either. I cannot say it better than Marc Veasey, the Congressman from the Dallas-Fort Worth area did today: ""Without the police, we would have anarchy in the streets. We would have no order, and the country that we live in wouldn't be the country that we know today--where we have a free press, where we have freedom of speech, where we have the right to gather and protest.""

The fact is that nobody hates dirty cops more than good cops. Nobody wants bad cops off the streets more than good cops. These few bad apples give good officers a bad name, they make their jobs harder, and they put their lives in danger--as evidenced by what happened in Dallas last night.  Meanwhile, no single group of people does more to protect black Americans on a daily basis than our police. That?™s the truth that we hardly ever hear.

At the same time, we must also admit that racism in America is real, and that there is a reason the relationship between police and the black community is so damaged. If you are a black person growing up in America, chances are pretty good that you have experienced the police pulling you over in front of your mother?™s house because you ?œhad a headlight out,??(This kind of thing has happened to me more than once.) You've probably been pulled over because you were driving a nice car in the wrong neighborhood. You've probably been asked to step out of your car for awhile and then released without being given a reason.

Unless you have lived through an experience like this, you cannot understand how violating it feels, or what it does to your ability to feel safe in your city--to trust the people who are supposed to protect you. Think about what this does to our children: if you?™re a black child watching CNN this week and you see video like the one in Minnesota, how are you not supposed to wonder if you are safe around police when you see them?

This is not an attack on our police, it?™s just a statement of fact: we cannot have unjust killings happening on our streets without a serious erosion in the confidence of the public. This threatens the very rule of law itself. This kind of fear only leads to more confrontation and violence. 

And yet, the only way to possibly make this situation worse is to respond with more violence. I understand the rage and anger many feel when they see violent images like this. But violence only begets more violence.

There will be a time to debate serious criminal justice reform, and I intend to talk about it a lot in the weeks ahead. But today is not that day. Today is a day to grieve, to hug our neighbors, to think about how we heal our communities.

Acts like the ones that took place in Minnesota and Dallas and Baton Rouge tear at the very fabric of America.  Frederick Douglass said, ""The ice under us in this country is very thin, and is made very weak by the warm fogs of prejudice.??
In the coming days, we must beware of those who would attempt to divide Americans along racial or political lines in a time of crisis. ?œWhite privilege??is not to blame, black parents who worry about their children being killed by police are not to blame, the Republican Party is not to blame, the Democratic Party is not to blame, the 2nd Amendment is not to blame. Evil people are to blame. Period.

I hope you will join me today in praying for the victims and their families. Pray for our police in Dallas who were injured last night, for the police across America watching the events in Dallas last night, and then getting up and doing their jobs today anyway.

7.9954E+14,Shaun King,799539910084929_1049671501738434,SHAUN KING: The man who murdered Trayvon is the walking personification of injustice.,"(My raw thoughts. Last update today. See you tomorrow.)

As I write these words, it's taking every bit of energy I have not to fall back on my most primal, carnal, base tendencies.

I shall not name the man who killed Trayvon Martin. I'm actually nervous about how that man makes me, and thousands of you, feel.

I've thought of killing him. I've wondered if it would be worth it. I?™m not suggesting anyone actually go out and do this, but I've considered what I would do if I saw him face to face. Would I tuck and run? Would I pretend like I didn't see him or would I rush him like a rabid dog and gouge his eyes out?

I've seen respectable women and men who don't have a violent bone in their body publicly wish death upon him. One of my closest relatives, a sweet woman, just texted me and said she wished someone would kill him.

It's frightening that this sorry sack of shit, this disgusting, vile, unrepentant, failure of a human being, makes us feel this way.

He is the living, breathing, walking, talking personification of injustice. He is injustice in the flesh. It nauseates us. It infuriates us. It takes us somewhere, emotionally, where we don't want to go, but we can't help it.

On the night of February 26, 2012, a teenage boy who was peacefully and legally walking in his own neighborhood, after purchasing some snacks to enjoy during the NBA All-Star Game weekend, was racially profiled and deemed a thug by this man.

The police dispatch operator told this man to not to pursue the boy. He ignored this request.

Because he was armed, and only because he was armed, he felt empowered to chase Trayvon Martin all through his neighborhood. Many of you have never been chased by strangers before in the dark of the night to understand just how terrifying it must've been. It's happened to me twice and each time scarred me for life.

It's not like playing tag. It's not like playing hide-and-seek with the lights out. It's altogether different. Within a minute or so of confronting Trayvon face to face, the boy was shot in chest and struggling to survive.

Now, Rosa Parks was not the first person to refuse to give up her seat on a public bus and Trayvon Martin was not the first person to be racially profiled and murdered, but each of those instances served as significant catalysts for two different protest movements.

They resonated with people. Whereas many sit-ins throughout the South came nearly a decade after the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the unrest of Ferguson came a full two-and-a-half years after Trayvon's death, each moment ignited something inside of millions of us and we just knew that we'd never take injustice lightly another day in our life.

I've spoken at universities all over the country this past year ??from Harvard, Princeton and Yale to high schools and community colleges. At each stop, I've communicated my belief that 2016 is just a new expression of 1956 or 1966.

Evil and racism haven't disappeared, they've just shape-shifted to a new generation.

We all assumed we were so much better and that our nation had evolved so much more than it really has.

Make no mistake, some valuable signs of progress exist, but the deadliest hate crime against African-Americans in modern history didn't happen in 1956, it happened last year in a Charleston church.

African-Americans are being assaulted and spat on at rallies for the presumptive Republican nominee for President of the United States.

The man who killed Trayvon ??he was meant for this time. He fits right in. His bigotry and ugliness don't make him an enigma, they make him normal in the new America. After all, Trump, bigotry and all, didn't hop into his nomination. He got there with millions votes.

This notion of selling the weapon he used to kill Trayvon with ??that's also not a new thing. It's very much like a lynching memento. For decades in this country, people saved ears and fingers and toes and teeth and even genitals of their lynching victims. They mailed postcards plastered with slain black bodies to cross-country destinations for laughs and giggles.

We've seen all this before.

In fact, we must ask ourselves when Donald Trump declares he wants to ""make America great again,"" what precise point in American history is he speaking of. I think I know and I think you do too.

~Kath","*Last Safeguards: Standing Your Ground, Guns, & The Right To Self Defense

The importance of protecting people's right to defend themselves cannot be overstated. Stripping the 2nd amendment would leave our country in a state where the only people with guns would be the police & government agencies who've become increasingly violently militarized & corrupt... Oh, & the violent criminals. 

Everywhere that has stripped the common man of their rights to protect themselves with the same weapons the aggressors can access has resulted in greater violence & bloodshed, rather than less. 

Who knows what atrocities have been averted by the 300,000,000 or so guns in our country that are largely kept responsibly for protection. 

Guns aren't just for taking lives. They protect & save them, too. 

The city of Chicago has some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation & their levels of violence only went up with the loss of their rights to defend themselves. They have a tendency towards hundreds of murders a year, having repeatedly topped out at over 500. Gun control causes violent crime to escalate.

http://youtu.be/L_-N9_tnWBo

Those responsible for the greatest violence towards the common man over the ages are governments. 

The genocidal/fascist governments have consistently shown that their preferred method of carrying this out, is eroding the rights of the people through manipulation until they finally disarm them. 

Once people are disarmed, who is there to resist orders that are unethical or worse?

Innocents Betrayed - The History of Gun Control
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUmKT43j4Tc

If you are unarmed and an armed person starts killing everyone around you, you have little recourse but to pray someone else with a gun puts a stop to it before everyone is killed. If you are unarmed, and an armed group menaces your family, there's not much you can do. If you are unarmed and a man with a gun gives you orders, you don't have much say, as you are in no position to argue.

In a country where everything is quickly spinning out of control, one of the last safeguards in place against total tyranny is the knowledge that there are many millions of armed citizens who will defend themselves & their loved ones should the need arise. That is a pretty powerful incentive for those who would want to undermine our freedom to seize upon any and all excuses to attempt to force disarmament.

Prohibition of any sort doesn't work. It just changes the dynamics of who controls a situation. It removes access only from the law-abiding common man. The increasingly abusive authorities & violent criminals will still, always be able to get access.

Prohibition has been shown to escalate crime in every instance, creating a black market where violent cartels take over supply & demand, often in tandem with clandestine branches of our own government. 

Our government has repeatedly & consistently shown that its willing to hold itself above the law as it plays both sides of prohibition to make use of the power and illicit funds it wields, yet faking the moral high ground incarcerating millions of people & using them as a virtual slave labor force while subsidizing companies that utilize that slave labor &/or ship american jobs overseas. 

They have consistently shown that they are willing to sink to unscrupulous depths as pretexts for draconian measures to erode our freedoms as they push their fascist agendas. Just how far would they go? Some examples can be found here. 

How Far
https://www.facebook.com/OccupyProhibition/photos/pb.317596638344614.-2207520000.1436982842./649316501839291/?type=3&theater

Britain & Australia each have full bans and their violent crime has worsened as a result. Now Britain is talking about banning long kitchen knives, because clearly, it's inanimate objects that are the problem rather than the people who wield them. 

Cannabis was outlawed. It never ceased to be available, and in fact is made easier for kids to access through the black market. It simply became one more excuse to criminalize people, & the punishments have escalated to ridiculous extremes - directed at non-violent people who are exercising their right to make decisions regarding their own bodies, harming no one, & otherwise law abiding. 

Really, it all boils down to freedom & personal responsibility. There will always be those out there who want to hurt others, & short of sticking us all in isolated padded cells, they're going to find a way. The vast majority of gun owners in this country are responsible & most of those guns are never used in ANY sort of crime... over 300,000,000.

While children's deaths are invariably tragic, the Sandy Hook event (along with similar events that are noteworthy in their suspicious resemblance to false flag events) has been deliberately sensationalized to drum up the outcry needed to strip our gun rights while the media remains largely silent to the multitude of people regularly averting disasters such as Sandy through prudent utilization of their second amendment right & the firearms they carried. 

As the *hypocritical Eric Holder put it, they are looking to ""Brainwash us into thinking about guns in a completely different way"". (*See Operation Fast and Furious, as well as the coincidental timing of various suspicious mass shootings with UN gun treaties & gun control agendas.)

Guns are an equalizer. They give you the chance to survive & protect people in the event that someone with evil intentions directs a weapon at you, a loved one, or anyone else around you. 

If you think supporting people's right to defend themselves is the problem, you need to brush up on your history, & you've still got a LOT of reading to do. 

Historically, the greatest atrocities carried out against people, where on the orders of the ruling classes.

Allow me to reiterate this point - Criminals, police, military... each can be dangerous depending on the individual & each will always have access to guns. Prohibiting guns will only strip them from those least likely to abuse them & most likely to use them responsibly. 

It will make criminals out of otherwise law-abiding citizens who demand their rights to protect themselves, their loved ones, property, & homes not be infringed upon. (That's one of the fundamentals our country was founded on.) 

It would be wonderful if we could live in a world where no one had any weapons and they weren't needed, but there will always be violent people within any group, particularly groups with any authority. (People in positions of authority often abuse those they have power over.)

As long as there's any group with access to guns, it will be necessary for the general population to have access to them as well, or terrible, escalating crime, oppression, & even genocides tend to start happening. 

The second amendment is there to allow people the right to protect themselves from any who may threaten, even government if it becomes tyrannical. Those safeguards were not implemented lightly. 

Given our country's rapid descent into an increasingly invasive police state with little regard for the safety of its people outside of using it as a pretext to systematically destroy our freedom, you might question just what motives there would be to strip our guns, if not benevolent.

You'd rather have a gun & not need it than need it and not have it in the event that a dangerous person or group of them is menacing you or your family.",06/06/2016 00:00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Republicans Have Not Only Embraced Hatred, It Is Now The Cornerstone Of Their Platform

For some unknown reason many Democrats, Liberals & Progressives have turned a blind eye to, or underestimated Right-wing bigotry, misogyny & homophobia.

In 2008 the Country was moving in a new direction of hope and change. After 8 horrific years of Republicans in the White House their numbers were dwindling. It was a time of panic & desperation for many in the Republican/Right-wing. Some in their party disliked Barack Obama simply because he was black. But those at the top feared and despised him because of what he represented, Hope & Change. These are the two things the wealthy have always fought against, for they could end what they like to see as the natural order of things.

To keep this from happening they would employ two old Republican standbys, Fear & Hate. Accomplishing this would require a propaganda machine the likes of which this Country or the World for that matter had never seen. Hate mongers spewing their hate on TV, Radio & the Web 24/7. A political party standing in unison opposing the President on any & everything. Never acknowledging any of his successes. Disrespecting the President & the office itself at every opportunity. This allows them to control &/or manipulate the ultimate single issue voters. Racists, Bigots, Sexists & Homophobes.

With the entire campaign of Misinformation, Hatred & Treason being funded by greedy Corporations & Billionaires. For you see many of the wealthy do not see average Americans as their equals. They see them as being beneath them, as simpletons or human livestock.

To defeat this great evil we must first acknowledge it...

Proverbs 4:7
In all thy getting get an understanding.

Many of our African American people have jump to conclusions and have become disgruntled about a meeting with Donald Trump and 100 black clergymen that will take place this coming Monday and I would like to address our community about this matter.

First and Foremost the initial call of invitation that I received more then a month ago was NEVER about endorsing Mr. Trump.  This meeting I was told had all to do with selected clergy being able to dialogue with Mr. Trump and to voice our concerns.  I accepted the invite with a mindset to hear Mr. Trump out and then question him and voice my concerns about his issues with:

1. The Black Lives Matter movement 

2. The call for President Obama's original birth certificate 

3. His tweet of a bogus statistic report of black people

4. The promotion of the already pervasive existence of racism, bigotry and xenophobia

Black clergy should be meeting with every Presidential candidate, Democratic or Republican. We should aggressively question them on the issues that impact our community and culture.

I'm not interested in being a part of a sideshow. These are serious times that call for serious issues to be addressed.  If this meeting is about a photo op and endorsing Mr. Trump campaign then this is not the meeting I prefer to attend.  If the meeting is about dialogue and I get a chance to voice my issues and concerns then I will be in attendance.   

If I attend I'm prepared to share my thoughts with Mr. Trump about the injustice and racism that still plaque our communities as well as enlighten him about our culture that has been misunderstood for years.

What happened to us? I know, Integration.  This took place back in 1915 when African Americans knew we were being insulted and fought back because we understood what you read, see and hear effects the way you think, feel, act and behave.  We understood the Propaganda of the Media.  Today, with all of our degrees, instead of fighting back we tune into the TEL-LIE-VISION and justify our own dehumanization by saying ?œIt?™s only entertainment??  Did our Ancestors die for this?

I talk about the landmark movie, ""The Birth of a Nation"" in my lecture series, ""The Media's Deliberate Destruction of The African American Family"" and ?œEMPIRE Strikes Black: The Propanda of The Media??  This movie caused race riots in the street because it infuriated European Americans so much.  It negatively depicted African American and unintelligent and ""Black Brutes"" who had uncontrolled sexual desires and showed them trying to rape ""White Virgins"".  It's based upon a novel by Thomas Dixon called ""The Klansman"".  This movie rejuvenated the Ku Klux Klan and was used as a recruitment tool by the Klan.  ""The Birth of A Nation"" was shown at the White House by President Woodrow Wilson and was also shown Internationally.

This was a classic example of the media being used as ?œPropaganda??to shape the way people think, feel, act and behave.  The ?œPropaganda??continues through the TEL-LIE-VISION (TV), Radio, in the music, Movies, etc.  The difference was that in 1915, the movie ?œThe Birth of a Nation?? had European Americans (White people) in ?œBlack Face??negatively depicting African Americans for a profit.  We protested against these negative depictions of ourselves because we had more self respect for ourselves in 1915.  Today, you have African Americans with a ?œBlack Face??mentality negatively depicting African Americans for profit and we for the most part are not protesting against these images because many of us have lost that self respect.

Whoever controls the images, controls your self-esteem, self-respect and self-development.  Whoever controls the History controls the vision"".  - Dr. Leonard Jeffries","One hundred years ago, the film that glorified the Ku Klux Klan and championed white supremacy was targeted by fledgling civil rights organizations and black media.",17/10/2015 00:00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

THE HYDRA HEAD OF THE BLACK SNAKE IS HERE IN NEW YORK
 
As thousands of people gather together at Standing Rock on the banks of the Missouri to protect their water from the Dakota Access Pipeline, Spectra Energy is currently working to run a massive 42??diameter, high pressure fracked gas pipeline under the Hudson River, 30 miles from New York City, 105 feet away from the Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant. This is happening now, in our own back yard.
 
The Algonquin Incremental Market Pipeline aka the ?œA.I.M??Pipeline, (also the acronym for the American Indian Movement) intersects two earthquake fault lines near the Indian Point reactor and then would continue through Connecticut, Massachusetts, and into Rhode Island for export. It is almost finished and has a turn on date of November 1st, 2016... in just a few weeks.
 
In New York alone, the ?œA.I.M??Pipeline puts over 20 million people at risk. It is insane. It is unthinkable. But it is real and it is happening NOW.
 
Governor Cuomo, Senators Schumer and Gillibrand, and other elected officials have all called on FERC (the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) to stop the ?œA.I.M.??pipeline until an independent analysis of the risk to public safety is conducted. FERC has denied these requests and the drilling continues. Meanwhile, Cuomo?™s independent assessment was stalled and several FERC employees have gone from approving the project to working for Spectra Energy. 

As the world turns to Standing Rock, we in New York are now directly connected to them, as Enbridge, who owns a stake in the Dakota Access Pipeline, has just announced their $28 billion purchase of Spectra Energy creating a North American energy-infrastructure giant1. They call the merger ?œThe Rainbow Project??

Let?™s answer their call. 

Standing Rock has shown us how people of all colors can come together in a prayerful way to stop these pipelines snaking their way across Turtle Island. For the sake of our children and everything we hold sacred, it is time for us to take a stand and stop this many headed black snake that is spewing poison into our water, earth, and air and spiraling us into uncontrollable global climate chaos. In this 11th hour the ?œA.I.M.??Pipeline must be stopped. #StopSpectra #NoDAPL #FrontlineToFrontline #WaterIsLife

4.07577E+14,America Needs a Truthful president,407577195956039_1171733456207072,Timeline Photos,"Everyone in the HILLARY media has taken 
to dismissing Donald Trump's claims that 
the election could be rigged. 

Here are eight times liberals claimed an 
election had been or would be stolen. 
______________________________________ 
  
?œI have never seen in my lifetime or in modern political history any presidential candidate trying to discredit the election process before votes have even taken place,??he said.

Obama?™s memory must be pretty short, so I?™ve compiled this list to remind him ??and everyone else ??of eight times liberals claimed an election was or would be stolen.

??1.) Labor Union Leader Roseann Demoro 
 
The national vice president of the AFL-CIO wrote an article for Salon in which she explained how the Democratic Party primary was ?œrigged from the start.??
She explained the debate times, media bias, and vote rigging were what kept Bernie Sanders from clinching the Democratic nomination for president. Demoro also claimed Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid met with casino owners where many caucuses were being held, in order to tamper with the election process.

?œThe Nevada caucuses were then rigged with massive voting irregularities such as casino owners orchestrating which workers would be allowed to vote and, in clear intimidation, openly monitoring how they voted,??she wrote.

??2.) NYU Professor Mark Crispin Miller 

This New York University professor has taught several courses and authored several books claiming that George W. Bush?™s presidential victories in 2000 and again in 2004 were the result of large-scale fraud. 

John Kerry lost the 2004 presidential election, Miller told Democracy Now! that the Democratic nominee said the election was stolen from him.

?œ[Kerry] told me he now thinks the election was stolen,??Miller said. ?œHe says he doesn?™t believe he is the person that can be out in front because of the sour grapes question. But he said he believes it was stolen.??
His book ?œLoser Take All: Election Fraud and The Subversion of Democracy, 2000 ??2008??explains how Republicans were going to try to steal the 2008 election away from Obama. Here?™s a synopsis of the book:

Among the subjects treated here are: myth of George Bush?™s victory in Florida in 2000, and FOX News?™s key role in propagating it; Senator Max Cleland?™s dubious defeat in Georgia in 2002; Bush?™s ?˜re-election??in 2004, including evidence of systematic fraud outside of Ohio; startling evidence of fraud committed in the 2006 midterm elections, which the Democrats appear to have won by a far larger margin than officially reported; and, crucially, evidence that the Republicans will attempt to steal the presidential election in 2008.
In a PBS interview from 2008, Miller explained that voting machines can?™t be trusted because the companies that make them have close ties to Republican candidates.

?œThe use of this kind of voting apparatus is extremely worrisome and something that we should be watching very carefully,??he said. 
   
Amusingly, the title of his 2005 book: ?œFooled Again: How the Right Stole the 2004 Election & Why They?™ll Steal the Next One Too (Unless We Stop Them)??appears to have been changed to simply ?œFooled Again: The Real Case For Election Reform.??The apparent change seems to imply that his fears of the elections being stolen in favor of the GOP were invalidated by Obama?™s 2008 victory.

??3.) Vox?™s Ezra Klein
In 2014, Klein wrote a piece explaining that the election process is skewed in favor of incumbent candidates. Once in office, candidates often get to have a say in where the electoral lines are drawn ??which means they can gerrymander their way into staying in office.

?œA new Rasmussen poll finds that 68 percent of Americans think elections are rigged in favor of incumbents,??he wrote. ?œAnd they?™re basically right. . . Few congressional elections are seriously competitive. Reelection rates for incumbents tend to hover around 90 percent.??
??4.) Vox?™s Dara Lind
Lind wrote a piece today entitled ?œA short history of white people rigging elections,??in which she explains how white people intimidated black people by acting violently towards them at the polls.

?œLet?™s be clear: Rigged elections have happened in American history,??she writes. ?œBut the people who?™ve most often rigged elections aren?™t liberal elites acting in cahoots with nonwhite shock troops ??they?™re white supremacists trying to maintain white power in the face of a diverse electorate.??
She?™s not wrong ??poll taxes, ?œliteracy tests,??and other methods were often employed to disenfranchise black people, but her assertion that it never happens in other circumstances is . . .  interesting.

What?™s ironic is the publication has taken strides to dismiss Trump?™s claims that the election process is rigged, publishing a piece today entitled ?œI?™m a Republican lawyer, here?™s why the election can?™t be rigged.??
Logan Dobson  put it on Twitter this way:

-------------------------------------------------- 

??5.) Politico?˜s Ben Wofford
In August, Wofford wrote a piece explaining how the election could be hacked in seven minutes. The piece focuses on a professor who bought an $82 voting machine and hacked with it so he could manipulate results.

?œIn American politics, an onlooker might observe that hacking an election has been less of a threat than a tradition,??he writes, citing Huey Long?™s infamous rigging in 1932, and the 1948 ?œLyndon Landslide??during which Lyndon B. Johnson ?œmysteriously overcame a 20,000 vote deficit in his first Senate race.??
??6.) Talking Points Memo?™s Josh Marshall
In 2006, Marshall accused the Ohio secretary of State of helping to steal the 2004 election in favor of Bush. Now, he says Trump?™s claims of election-rigging are ?œdisgusting.??
??7.) Salon?™s Farhad Manjoo
?œWas the New Hampshire vote stolen???Manjoo asked of the 2008 New Hampshire primary Clinton unexpectedly won.

In recent years several factors ??1) crazily hackable voting machines, 2) generally heightened partisanship, 3) very close races, and 4) a real, honest-to-goodness purloined race (see Bush v. Gore) ??have raised the paranoid in all of us. Wondering if any election outcome is honest has become a standard post-election emotion; not wondering, now that?™s just crazy.
Manjoo concluded his piece by saying that even if we fixed our voting machines, it still wouldn?™t make elections fair.

??8.) Sen. Elizabeth Warren
Today, Warren chided Trump on Twitter:

In 2013, however, Warren went on the Senate floor to chastise Republicans for making ?œnaked attempts to nullify the results of the last presidential election. To force us to govern as though President Obama hadn?™t won the 2012 election.??At the time, she conveniently seems to have forgotten that Republicans in Congress had also won an electoral mandate through their own re-elections. Unless she was implying Republican lawmakers??re-elections were fraudulent despite being conducted by the same process as Obama?™s re-election.

As John Gibbs wrote, voter fraud is very much a real thing. According to a 2012 Pew Charitable Trust report, roughly 18 million voter registrations are either ?œsignificantly inaccurate??or invalid ??enough to tip an election. Yet somehow when Donald Trump echoes the concerns about election integrity many Americans have had for years, it?™s totally insane. I guess election-rigging only matters when Democrats lose.

Fed by leftist mass hysteria, a radical academic vanguard, and an increasingly greedy racial-grievance industry.

A hate crime aimed at black students at Maryland's Salisbury University has been revealed as just the latest high-profile race-related hoax to hit the groves of academe in the race-obsessed Obama era.

Except for acknowledging that the two perpetrators are African-American students at the school that is located on the Delmarva Peninsula in eastern Maryland, the university is engaged in a cover-up. If the perpetrators were white, a cynic might say that the school would find a way to leak out the pertinent details in order to make a political statement.

1.81135E+11,Law Enforcement Today,181135410243_10156254419525244,Timeline Photos,"San Bernardino Shooting Investigators See Terrorism Links

SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. ??The F.B.I. is treating its inquiry into the massacre here as a counter-terrorism investigation, two law enforcement officials said Thursday, based on materials the suspects stockpiled ??including explosives ??their Middle East travels and evidence that one of them had been in touch with people with Islamist extremist views, both in the United States and abroad.

The suspects, a married couple identified as Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 27, are believed to have opened fire inside a social services center on Wednesday, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others, in the nation?™s deadliest mass shooting since the assault on an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., nearly three years ago. The suspects died hours later in a shootout with the police on a residential street.

Law enforcement officials said Thursday that the couple had thousands of rounds of ammunition in their home as well as 12 pipe bombs. ?œWe do not yet know the motive,??David Bowdich, the assistant director of the F.B.I. office in Los Angeles, said in a news conference.

While Mr. Farook is an American citizen, Mr. Bowdich said he had traveled abroad and that the couple came to the United States in July 2014 when they were not yet married. She is here on a K-1 visa on a Pakistani passport. Mr. Bowdich said he did not know all of the countries they visited but that Mr. Farook did go to Pakistan at one point.
Asked whether there were contacts with possible terrorist suspects, he said ?œWe are still working through that.??Authorities added that there was certain level of sophistication in the explosive devices.

Law enforcement officials said the F.B.I. had uncovered evidence that Mr. Farook was in contact over several years with extremists domestically and abroad, including at least one person in the United States who was investigated for suspected terrorism by federal authorities in recent years. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

Officials said they were unclear what set off the attack, given that the target was a group of Mr. Farook?™s co-workers with the county health department. They say it may have also involved grievances against them.

?œYou don?™t take your wife to a workplace shooting, and especially not as prepared as they were,??said a senior law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. ?œHe could have been radicalized, ready to go with some type of attack, and then had a dispute at work and decided to do something.??
Two other senior United States security officials said that F.B.I. counter-terrorism officials were overseeing the investigation because of the possibility that it might be terrorism, not because they had concluded that it was.

The officials called the case perplexing, saying that no clear evidence of terrorism had emerged and that there were some signs pointing away from it. But they said the shooting was clearly premeditated, and does not fit the mold for typical workplace violence incidents. The idea that this was a workplace argument that spiraled out of control seems far-fetched now, the officials said, given the explosives and the preparation. An overnight review of Mr. Farook?™s electronic devices has not provided clear answers to these questions, but the officials noted that the investigation is in its early phases.

The F.B.I. has investigated thousands of Muslims for their potential ties to terrorists in the years since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, many of whom were never linked to any crimes. But details about Mr. Farook that have emerged, including the equipment the attackers had that indicating a preparedness to commit violence on a large scale, has prompted investigators to look deeper into whether he had connections to militants or extremist ideology.

The attackers arrived at Inland Regional Center, at 11 a.m. Wednesday, armed with .223-caliber assault rifles, semiautomatic handguns, and explosives that they left behind but that did not detonate, law enforcement officials have said, and witnesses have said they wore masks and body armor.

The suspicion of terrorism appears to focus the hunt for a motive in the blood bath. Meanwhile federal agents traced the origins of the four guns recovered from the suspects, all of them bought legally, and officers combed through a sprawling set of crime scenes for evidence.

President Obama said in an Oval Office statement Thursday morning that it was possible that the attacks in San Bernardino were terrorist-related, but he said it was also possible they were work-related. At this stage, he said, law enforcement still does not know why this ?œterrible event occurred.??He said the F.B.I. was investigating.

Two of the people wounded in the attack remained in critical condition Thursday morning and three others were listed in fair condition at Loma Linda University Medical Center, Kerry Heinrich, the chief executive of the hospital, said. ?œAll of the patients are gunshot wound victims,??he said, declining to give more detail.

Coroner?™s teams were still working at Inland Regional on Thursday, and law enforcement officials said some of the bodies of victims remained there.

Two of the guns recovered were bought by one of the suspects killed in the shootout, and the other two were bought by a third person who is not considered a suspect, said a senior federal law enforcement official, who was spoke on the condition of anonymity. ?œWe believe all four were purchased legally, but are still taking a close look at the two firearms bought by the??person who is not a suspect, the official said.

The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives confirmed that it had traced all four guns, and that two were purchased legally by someone linked to the investigation. But neither the senior official nor the bureau would identify either buyer by name, nor say which two weapons were bought by a suspect, or where they were bought.

Officials said the two assault rifles were variants of the AR-15, the semiautomatic version of the military M-16 rifle; one was made by DPMS Panther Arms, and the other was a Smith & Wesson M&P model, a designation meaning military and police. The senior law enforcement official said one handgun was made by Llama, and the other by Smith and Wesson.

California is among a handful of states that ban the sale or possession of many assault weapons, including the most common models, but there are exceptions in the law, and it is not clear whether the suspects??guns were prohibited. It was not known where and how the suspects obtained their weapons, which might have been sold originally in other states, and might have gone through multiple owners. Overall, California has the strictest gun laws in the nation, according to the most recent report card by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

Mr. Farook had been at a holiday party at the center for the county health department, where he worked as an environmental inspector. He soon left in anger after a dispute of some sort, Chief Jarrod Burguan of the San Bernardino Police Department said, only to return alongside Ms. Malik. Hours later, the couple were killed during the shootout.

Through the night, investigators scoured at least three sites looking for clues: the scene of the shooting at the Inland Regional Center, a sprawling facility that provides services for thousands of people with disabilities where the holiday party was held; the site about two miles away where the couple died in a shootout; and a townhouse in nearby Redlands.

Officers used a crane to break through windows and the door at the small townhouse and set off controlled explosions inside the home, fearing the suspects could have left explosives behind. Bomb squads had also disposed of explosives the suspects left behind them at the regional center.

By Thursday, none of the victims of the attack had been publicly identified.

Most of the carnage unfolded in a single room of the Inland Regional Center, the police said, which was filled with people with whom Mr. Farook had a personal connection. While shots rang out, others in the building cowered and hid, sending text messages or making frantic calls.

As the suspects fled in a black sport utility vehicle, large parts of the city were paralyzed. Residents were told to remain indoors, and government buildings, stores, offices and at least one school were either closed or put on lockdown. Yellow school buses filled with survivors of the shooting were escorted by police vans to meet anxious relatives at a church.

Late Wednesday afternoon, dozens of heavily armed police officers in tactical gear descended on a residential neighborhood in pursuit of the attackers. Witnesses described a wild scene as dozens of officers closed in on a vehicle, with hundreds of shots fired as the people in the vehicle fought the police.

Chief Burguan said there were at least 20 officers involved in the gun battle.

The chief said that a third person had fled the scene and been taken into custody, but that the police did not know his role, if any. A police officer was wounded in the shootout and was being treated at a hospital for injuries that were not life-threatening.

Loma Linda, the only Level One trauma center in the region, had been prepared for far more casualties, and put out an all-hands call for ?œall trauma surgeons, all nursing staff, all support staff??to report to the hospital, Mr. Heinrich said. A bomb threat against the hospital, apparently unfounded, complicated its work, and led to heavily armed equipped police tactical units searching the center room by room.

?œOur staff have trained, have prepared, but there?™s nothing you can do, really, to prepare for an event like yesterday, with the emotional trauma that comes with that,??Mr. Heinrich said.

In a year repeatedly marked by such massacres, San Bernardino joined a tragic roster that includes Charleston, S.C.; Roseburg, Ore.; and Colorado Springs, where just five days earlier a gunman killed three people and wounded nine at a Planned Parenthood clinic.

President Obama once again called for better background checks and new restrictions on access to guns.

?œWe should come together in a bipartisan basis at every level of government to make these rare as opposed to normal,??he said on CBS News. He said: ?œThe one thing we do know is that we have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere else in the world. And there?™s some steps we could take, not to eliminate every one of these mass shootings, but to improve the odds that they don?™t happen as frequently.?http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/san-bernardino-shooting-investigators-see-terrorism-links/ar-AAfYDHC?li=BBnb7Kz",,03/12/2015 00:00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But at least in the shank of the evening over an adult beverage or two that was something we would speculate about. What no one ever thought to even discuss was whether we would have legalized gay marriage anywhere, let alone now in all 50 states. 

It might be difficult for some of my younger readers to realize, but for most of my life what we now refer to as the LGBT community was never discussed in ""polite"" company. And all of the horrible epithets for gays were bandied about without a second thought. Today President Obama mentions LGBT in a speech and no one takes notice. The White House is bathed in a rainbow light and it becomes an internet meme. It's a far cry from what Democratic Senator Edmund Muskie was quoted as saying when he ran for president in 1972. ""Goddamn it, if I have to be nice to a bunch of sodomites to be elected President, then f--k it."" That was certainly the prevailing political calculation at the time. 

I was raised in a religious household in Texas and I understand the deeply-held religious beliefs that many people who are concerned with the Supreme Court ruling have. (I distinguish this from the cynical political motives driving some public officials and media personalities to decry marriage equality). I do believe that people of good faith can disagree on this. But at the same time, I am heartened that so many of my fellow Americans are changing their minds. It's a journey I myself have followed. 

When I was young, I wasn't very enlightened on gay issues. I probably, if asked at the time, wouldn't have been very tolerant by today's standards. But two important things happened. One is that I had some very close friends come out to me. This was decades ago and it reoriented me, an experience I imagine is similar for so many people. It's easy to see gays as ""others"" until one is a close family member, colleague or friend. 

The other thing that happened is I saw my mission as a journalist to give voice to the powerless. And for most of my career the LGBT community was the voiceless and powerless. There is more to be done but I am happy today that LGBT voices are now a much fuller part of our national discourse. We are a better nation because of it.

Both Hillary and Bill Clinton have argued that their support for the 1994 crime bill was simply a response to black demands for ""get tough"" measures.   Yet, as these scholars point out:  ""The historical record reveals a different story. Instead of being the unintended consequence of the democratic process at work, punitive crime policy is a result of a process of selectively hearing black voices on the question of crime. . . .  Policy makers pointed to black support for greater punishment and surveillance, without recognizing accompanying demands to redirect power and economic resources to low-income minority communities.""  

The NAACP called the crime bill ""a crime against the American people.""  The Congressional Black Caucus supported an alternative bill that provided alternatives to incarceration, drug treatment and major investment and assistance for young people trapped in ghettoized communities.  That approach was rejected.   Some black politicians agreed to support the 1994 crime bill anyway, believing that the kind of investment and assistance that was desperately needed would eventually come.  It didn't.

Instead, we got militarized police, prisons, and the dismantling of welfare for the poorest and most vulnerable among us, plunging more than a million more kids into severe poverty.  We got a system of mass incarceration unparalleled in world history.  

No, this is not what black communities wanted.  And no, this is not what we asked for.  As explained here, this pattern of ""selective hearing"" of black voices has a long history in America -- a history that will never end so long as we keep electing opportunistic politicians who hear us only when it is convenient for them.",14/04/2016 00:00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jay-Z is one of the most iconic rap artists of the last generation.

His entire staff is white.

Jay-Z tried to blame Apple, Pandora, Spotify, Google and YouTube for the failure of his new music streaming company called Tidal ??which is headquartered in a country that is 97% caucasian. And then his wife tweeted a photo of the duo with the staff at Tidal. Oops.
Yet, you can?™t accuse your competition of treating you like a slave and effectively pull the race card for your failures when your entire staff appears to be white. You also can?™t link your situation to the deaths of the major African-Americans over this last year when you?™re a multi-billionaire who just had a bad idea. Here is how Jay-Z tried to compare his company?™s flop to those deaths:
Well I can?™t tell how they killed Freddie Gray, right, shot down Mike Brown how they did Tray, right?
Let ?˜em continue choking n?”as, we gonna turn style, I ain?™t your token n?”a.
?œYou bought nine iPhones and Steve Jobs is rich, Phil Knight is worth trillions, you still bought them kicks, Spotify is nine billion, they ain?™t say s?“t.
?¦the only one they hating on looks just like you.


Lmao nah when I saw someone bring up Tidal?™s staff being all white, I knew y?™all were officially doomed.

Within a week the press found every woman with whom Tiger had an affair during the previous few years. They uncovered photos, text messages, recorded phone calls, airline tickets, etc. They not only knew the cause of the family fight they even knew it was a 9 iron from his golf bag that his wife used to break out the windows in the Escalade.

Each and every day the press continued to provide America with updates on Tiger's sex rehab stay, his wife's divorce settlement figures, dates of tournaments in which he planned to play and more.

Barack Hussein Obama has been in office for over six years. This very same press cannot find any of his childhood friends or neighbors; any of Obama's high school or college classmates. They cannot locate any of his college papers or grades. He served as editor of the Harvard Law Review, yet the press cannot produce a single copy of HLR?™s from his days at the helm.

Our ?˜determined??press cannot determine how he paid for both a Columbia and a Harvard education or discover which country issued his visa to travel to Pakistan in the 1980s. They cannot find Michelle Obama's Princeton thesis on racism. 

They just can't seem to uncover any of this. Why not?",22/08/2015 00:00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Why did no one protest when Kate Steinle and others are gunned down by illegal immigrants? Why are there no protests when our law enforcement officers are gunned down? Heck, why were there no calls for protests after San Bernardino and Orlando?

Here?™s the deal, the progressive socialist left has been building this tinderbox and it was just set afire. They?™ve been stoking this potential wildfire and our worst fears suddenly came to fruition. They?™ve allowed people to march and chant ?œWhat do we want, dead cops, when do we want them, now??and ?œPigs in a blanket, fry ?™em like bacon.??There have been countless rushes to judgment ??namely Ferguson, Missouri ??along with the incessant castigations of racism, and this is where it ends.

In North Charleston, SC a bad cop is in jail and will certainly be held accountable for his actions. But what did we see in Charleston, including the Mother Emmanuel Church shooting ??no rabble rousing, just justice being served. That is how a civilized society exists, operates and sustains itself.

But that is not the world of the followers of Saul Alinsky, the rules for radicals. And they know exactly who they are.

Shock Poll: Trump Gets 20 Percent of Black Vote in Florida Poll; Leads Clinton Overall 43 to 41

black voters trump
Twenty percent of African-American voters in Florida support Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump according to a poll released Wednesday by Florida Atlantic University.

The poll hit as Trump is visiting Tampa for a mid-day rally at the State Fairgrounds.

The poll shows Trump with a two point lead of rival Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, 43 to 41 percent, within the poll?™s 2.7 percent margin of error. Clinton has the support of 68 percent of African-American voters in Florida. 1200 registered Florida voters were surveyed from August 19-22.

The Washington Post reported in 2014 that incumbent Republican Governor Rick Scott received twelve percent of the Black vote for his reelection bid, noting that was an eight point improvement over 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney?™s performance with Florida?™s Black voters and Scott?™s 2010 support.

?œIn Florida, Gov. Rick Scott (R) hit double digits, earning 12 percent of the black vote ??an 8-point bump from Romney and from Scott?™s showing in 2010.??
In recent weeks Trump has made outreach to Black voters a significant part of his campaign.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/11/06/the-gop-moved-the-ball-forward-with-black-voters-but-progress-is-slow/",Its 11 percent share of the black vote is the biggest since 2006 but not historically high.,24/08/2016 00:00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Queen

""Over 1,400 executions later with almost 3,000 mostly men lingering for years on the nation?™s death rows, capital punishment looks increasingly dysfunctional due to the continued judicial failure to satisfactorily regulate the way death sentences are reached. The current debate over capital punishment is no longer focused on contested moral visions about taking a life but rather on the effectiveness, accuracy and cost of the agonizingly detailed, superficially rational, regulatory universe the Court has brought into being. The key conflict exposed in often contradictory judicial opinions is an effort to accomplish two inconsistent goals??to individualize selection of the condemned so punishment fits the offender and offense while at the same time attempting to assure that the states avoid arbitrary or racially based sentencing. But once a single jury is instructed to see a defendant as unique there is no way the life-death choices of different juries over time can be anything but random.""",The turbulent post-war years of the 1950s made it imperative that the United States to confront the way it treated black citizens.

Meanwhile, it's racist against blacks and Hispanics because it patronizes and infantilizes these groups, insinuating that they cannot take care of themselves without special privileges.

#WeLoveIsrael  

J Space-News Daily is reporting:

An Israeli flag was set alight as protesters chanted ?œLong live the intifada??outside the venue of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.

Protesters also burned pro-Bernie Sanders posters and some American flags on Tuesday night as Hillary Clinton was being nominated the party?™s official presidential candidate. Palestinian flags also were waved both inside the convention and outside the Wells Fargo Center in downtown Philadelphia.

Photos of the flag burning were posted on social media.

The Israeli flag was burned by a woman who concealed her face with a black bandana as people around her reportedly cheered.

The National Jewish Democratic Council in a tweet called the flag burning ?œDisgusting and totally reprehensible??and the protesters ?œanti-progressive.??,,https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13626537_10155134761994698_2079136644812925007_n.jpg?oh=8bd535f1840367d5b1c5bd9af26244d3&oe=58153163,https://www.facebook.com/jerusalemprayerteam/photos/a.10150308507814698.419438.292351509697/10155134761994698/?type=3,,1107.0,963,117,116.0,2016-07-27 18:05:32,2016-07-28 04:55:51,2016-07-27 00:00:00,2016-07-28 00:00:00,2016-07-27T23:05:32+0000,2016-07-28T09:55:51+0000,1238071.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,

?œThere is abundant evidence that we are being contacted, that civilizations have been monitoring us for a very long time. That their appearance is bizarre from any type of traditional materialistic western point of view.

?œDecades ago, visitors from other planets warned us about the direction we were heading and offered to help. Instead, some of us interpreted their visits as a threat, and decided to shoot first and ask questions after.

With Hillary's unpopularity reaching record levels making her the most unpopular Democratic nominee in American history as ABC and Clinton cheerleader the Washington Post reporting ""Among all adults, 56 percent now view Clinton unfavorably, up 6 percentage points in three weeks, compared with 63 percent who say the same about Trump. Among registered voters, the two candidates have nearly identical unfavorable ratings: 59 percent for Clinton versus 60 percent for Trump.??And those are the numbers given by the Mainstream Media that supports the Clinton machine. The Washington Post even added that ?œif it weren?™t for Trump, in fact, Clinton would be the most unpopular major-party presidential nominee in modern American history.??
Why is she so unpopular? It?™s simple, most people hate being lied to. And Hillary?™s entire career is a series of lies in slow motion. Just a few of the zingers include She said she ""never received nor sent any material that was marked classified"" on her private email server while secretary of state. FALSE. She said

From Transpartisan Note #14:
?œI (Glenn Beck) consider myself a ?˜classical liberal?˜â€?a.k.a. ?˜constitutional conservative????and I believe the greatness of our country lies in our founders??creation of a system that allows and encourages all voices to be heard. The only way for our society to work is for each of us to respect the views of others, and even understand and empathize with one another. I have always tried to work toward this goal, even though I have often been guilty of conflating the individual with the whole.??
When a contrarian, conservative, combatant like Glenn Beck uses these words we believe it makes sense to listen. What he said next underscored our belief.
?œAfter the massacre [of Dallas police officers], I invited several Black Lives Matter believers on my show. I got to know them as people ??on and off air ??and invited them back again. These individuals are decent, hardworking, patriotic Americans. We don?™t agree on everything, certainly not on politics; but are we not more than politics? ?¦they are black Americans who feel disenfranchised and aggrieved; they are believers; they are my neighbors and my fellow citizens.""

Christopher Driscoll teaches religious studies at Lehigh University. He claims consulting with hip-hop artist Asheru, as well as Kashi Johnson who is another Lehigh associate professor, to create the brilliant list below reported by Campus Reform.
1. #AllLivesMatter won?™t matter until #BlackLivesMatter. This commandment is a litmus test and the greatest commandment.
2. Always remember that white privilege is real, even if you do not understand it. Use it to convince other people that black lives, including black women?™s lives, matter. Show up for protests, write letters to representatives, and start discussions with other white people about black lives mattering.
3. Always remember that ignorance is real, and is a product of privilege. Treat the ignorant with compassion, but hold them accountable.
4. Never think that the critique does not apply to you. Just because you were at Barack?™s inauguration and your dad was a freedom rider, or because you are the head of your local chapter of GLADD, that does not mean you do not have more work to do on yourself, your family, and your community.
5. Always remember that it is never a question of if violence, but whose violence are you going to defend. Unjust state-sanctioned and racist violence, or justified resistance; the choice is yours, the choice is ours.
6. Never tolerate racism from your friends or family. Whether it is coming from your eighteen-year-old friend, your thirty-one-year-old cousin, or your eighty-year-old grandmother, confront it always. Confronting racism does not mean you will lose your friend or family. It means you will help to make them act and think in less racist ways.
7. You cannot love cultural products without also loving the people who make those products. If you like black art or athletics, that appreciation is an entryway into recognizing that black lives matter.
8. Never quote black leaders like Dr. King in order to criticize protesters and activists.
9. Always embrace uncertainty. Life is uncertain; death is certain. Uncertainty promotes life; certainty produces death and destruction.
10. Never put white fragility ahead of justice. If you are more concerned to argue that you ?œaren?™t racist??than you are with racism or with people dying, you?™re priorities are skewed. Do you want justice or comfort?
It?™s disheartening to see allegedly well educated men fueling further racism in our country. Just the mere fact that their list is dubbed the ?œTen Cracka Commandments,??is completely discrediting before you even read the first one.

We Americans have become a race of spoiled people. Technology and science have provided us with conveniences that have lengthened our lives and shortened our steps, things once considered wonders that we have assimilated into our lifestyles and now take for granted.

We tend to get frustrated when the batteries in the TV remote become weak and wont change the channel in two seconds or the garage door opener gets stuck and a flat tire is enough to bring on a hissy fit.

We forget that a few short years ago you had to walk up to the TV and turn a knob, get out of your car and open the garage door, get back in the car and drive through and then get out of the car and close it again, and flat tires were a pretty common occurrence that could be remedied with a jack and a lug wrench in about ten minutes.

Now we spend more than ten minutes cussing and fussing about it before we even start to go through the convoluted process of locating the jack.

We complain if the traffic is slower than usual, if the mail is late, if an outing gets rained out or a faucet drips.

There are people you dread to see coming or to talk to on the phone because they always find something to complain about, in fact some of them are serial complainers and have refined complaining to an art form.

""Sally was supposed to pick me up for work this morning and she called about ten till and said her baby was sick, well its no wonder she lets it eat all that junk, so I drove the car in, but Bill had forget to fill it up and I ran out of gas right in the middle of the road, if I?™ve told Bill once I?™ve told him a thousand times to keep gas in the car, anyway I went to call a tow truck and my cell phone was dead and I had to leave the car and walk up to a drugstore and use the a pay phone but I didn?™t have any change and the druggist couldn?™t break a twenty, anyway, he let me use the his phone and it took the tow truck two hours to get there and I had to sit in the car and wait in that 90 degree weather and when the tow truck came all he did was put five gallons of gas in the car and charge me seventy five dollars and then I was three hours late getting to work and that little smart aleck supervisor, you know the one with the frizzy hair and wears all the make up, well she just chewed me out. How was your day???  

Although I am by no means immune to a little complaining I have discovered that it?™s a total waste of time and is a source of irritation to the people you happen to be around. Nobody wants to hear anybody else complain, it?™s like finger nails on a blackboard.

Practically all the doctors I go to have their offices in a big hospital and it only takes going by for a check up for me to realize that I really have no complaints. I see people who have a lot more to complain about than I do.

When I see a mentally disturbed street person or a parent with a sick child or someone who has lost their job or a wounded warrior returning from Afghanistan or a cancer patient fighting for their lives, my complaints seem so insignificant as to be non existent. 

Complaining can become a habit, a part of one's personality and become so natural that they approach any situation that is less than perfect by complaining.

The Bible encourages us to fix our thoughts on the pure, the lovely, the positive.

It takes a lot more energy to think bout something negative as it does to think about something positive.

It?™s natural to become irritated when things go wrong, but if we'll only admit it, most of our problems are small and dealing with them in a positive frame of mind makes solving them a much simpler task. 

Complaining about something won't make it go away, deal with it and count your blessings

What do you think?

Pray for our troops and the peace of Jerusalem

God Bless America

When Tonya Slaton, 44, was pulled over by a Virginia State Police trooper, he discovered a black trash bag in the trunk that contained human remains.
The vehicle was initially pulled over for expired tags, but after it was revealed that the car was not registered in Virginia and the license plates were not on file with the Department of Motor Vehicles, the trooper began the process of impounding the vehicle, which includes taking inventory of its contents.
While taking inventory, the trooper discovered the black trash bag sealed with duct tape in the trunk with a body inside. A strong odor of rotting flesh was coming from the bag, according to police.
Slaton allegedly told the trooper the bag was filled with clothes.
Virginia State Police have now confirmed that the remains belonged to Slaton?™s biological son, Quincy Jamar Davis, CBS 6 reports.
Davis was last seen in 2004, when he was in the 7th grade in Virginia Beach, Virginia.
?œThe victim?™s death was likely the result of some homicidal action,??one investigator stated on a search warrant.
A missing persons report was never filed for Davis and police are currently asking anyone with information to come forward.

Critics of the shooting claimed the man was running away

RALEIGH, N.C. ??A white North Carolina officer fatally shot a black man during a struggle when the man pulled a gun from his waistband and then reached toward the officer's weapon, police said Thursday.

Officer D.C. Twiddy had been trying to arrest 24-year-old Akiel Denkins on Monday when the two got into a struggle, according to a report from Raleigh Police Chief C.L. Deck-Brown released Thursday. The report, which is the first detailed description of the shooting in a predominantly black neighborhood of modest homes south of downtown Raleigh, gives the following account:

Twiddy stopped his cruiser when he saw Denkins because he knew the man had an outstanding warrant on felony drug charges. Denkins started to run, ducking between two houses and jumping a fence into a home's backyard.

Twiddy slipped on loose gravel as he tried to catch Denkins, then hurdled the fence and confronted the suspect as he tried to climb a second fence. Denkins stopped and turned toward Twiddy. As the two struggled, Twiddy said Denkins reached for a handgun in the front of his waistband. That's when Twiddy fired several shots.

The two continued to struggle, and the officer then felt Denkins' hand or arm ""make contact"" with his weapon.

""Officer Twiddy, fearing that Mr. Denkins was either going to shoot him or attempt to take his duty weapon, stepped back and fired additional shots at Mr. Denkins, who still had the firearm in his hand,"" the report said.

At that point, Denkins collapsed and dropped the gun, which had previously been reported stolen.

There is no dash cam video of the shooting because it happened away from the officer's patrol car, and because the car's blue lights weren't turned on, which is necessary to activate the camera.

Separately, Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman also said Thursday that a preliminary autopsy shows Denkins was shot in his right chest, left forearm, right upper arm, and right shoulder. The gunshots caused injuries to Denkins' heart and lungs.

The medical examiner is still looking into how and where the bullets entered 24-year-old Akiel Denkins' body. When asked if Denkins was shot in the back, as one witness suggested after the shooting, she said only that the medical examiner's office was not authorized to release that information yet because information is still being reviewed internally.

That witness, Claresa Williams, said she saw the confrontation develop and heard six gunshots but did not see Denkins fall from the bullets.

Twiddy has been placed on administrative leave.

About 20 people milled around calmly early Thursday evening at the makeshift memorial next to the shooting scene. Kasual Walker, 33, said she knew Denkins for several years and didn't believe Denkins was drawing a gun on the officer.

Irv Joyner, a lawyer representing the NAACP, said he is helping Denkins' family interview witnesses. People will accept the truth when all the facts are known, said Joyner, a professor of law at North Carolina Central University in Durham.

""Our community is resilient and they're going to accept the truth,"" he said. ""So we will be looking at that as soon as it is turned over to us.""

1.42474E+14,Robert Reich,142474049098533_1169974199681841,,"This week's essay:

American Fascist

I?™ve been reluctant to use the  ?œf??word to describe Donald Trump because it?™s especially harsh, and it?™s too often used carelessly.

But Trump has finally reached a point where parallels between his presidential campaign and the fascists of the first half of the 20th century ??lurid figures such as Benito Mussolini, Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Oswald Mosley, and Francisco Franco ??are too evident to overlook.

It?™s not just that Trump recently quoted Mussolini (he now calls that tweet inadvertent) or that he?™s begun inviting followers at his rallies to raise their right hands in a manner chillingly similar to the Nazi ?œHeil??solute (he dismisses such comparison as ?œridiculous.??

The parallels go deeper.

As did the early twentieth-century fascists, Trump is focusing his campaign on the angers of white working people who have been losing economic ground for years, and who are easy prey for demagogues seeking to build their own power by scapegoating others.

Trump?™s electoral gains have been largest in counties with lower than average incomes, and among those who report their personal finances have worsened. As the Washington Post?™s Jeff Guo has pointed out, Trump performs best in places where middle-aged whites are dying the fastest.  

The economic stresses almost a century ago that culminated in the Great Depression were far worse than most of Trump?™s followers have experienced, but they?™ve suffered something that in some respects is more painful ??failed expectations.

Many grew up during the 1950s and 1960s, during a postwar prosperity that lifted all boats. That prosperity gave their parents a better life. Trump?™s followers naturally expected that they and their children would also experience economic gains. They have not.

Add fears and uncertainties about terrorists who may be living among us, or may want to sneak through our borders, and this vulnerability and powerlessness is magnified.

Trump?™s incendiary verbal attacks on Mexican immigrants and Muslims ??even his reluctance to distance himself from David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan ??follow the older fascist script.  

That older generation of fascists didn?™t bother with policy prescriptions or logical argument, either. They presented themselves as strongmen whose personal power would remedy all ills.

They created around themselves cults of personality in which they took on the trappings of strength, confidence, and invulnerability ??all of which served as substitutes for rational argument or thought.  

Trump?™s entire campaign similarly revolves around his assumed strength and confidence. He tells his followers not to worry; he?™ll take care of them. ?œIf you get laid off ?? I still want your vote,??he told workers in Michigan last week. ?œI?™ll get you a new job; don?™t worry about it.??
The old fascists intimidated and threatened opponents. Trump is not above a similar strategy. To take one example, he recently tweeted that Chicago?™s Ricketts family, now spending money to defeat him, ?œbetter be careful, they have a lot to hide.??
The old fascists incited violence. Trump has not done so explicitly but Trump supporters have attacked Muslims, the homeless, and African-Americans ??and Trump has all but excused their behavior.

Weeks after Trump began his campaign by falsely alleging that Mexican immigrants are ?œbringing crime. They?™re rapists,??two brothers in Boston beat with a metal poll and urinated on a 58-year-old homeless Mexican national. They subsequently told the police ?œDonald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported.??
Instead of condemning that brutality, Trump excused it by saying ?œpeople who are following me are very passionate. They love this country and they want this country to be great again.??
After a handful of white supporters punched and attempted to choke a Black Lives Matter protester at one of his campaign rallies, Trump said ?œmaybe he should have been roughed up.??
There are further parallels. Fascists glorified national power and greatness, fanning xenophobia and war. Trump?™s entire foreign policy consists of asserting American power against other nations. Mexico ?œwill??finance a wall. China ?œwill??stop manipulating its currency.  

In pursuit of their nationalistic aims, the fascists disregarded international law. Trump is the same. He recently proposed using torture against terrorists, and punishing their families, both in clear violation of international law. 

The old fascists perfected the art of the ""big lie"" -- making up facts to suit their twisted views, and then repeating them until they seem commonplace. Trump doesn't seem to care about the truth. Even when his statements are shown to be utter fabrications -- as his assertion that Arabs cheered when the World Trade Center went down -- he continues to repeat them. 

Finally, the fascists created their mass followings directly, without political parties or other intermediaries standing between them and their legions of supporters.  

Trump?™s tweets and rallies similarly circumvent all filters. The Republican Party is irrelevant to his campaign, and he considers the media an enemy. (Reporters covering his rallies are kept behind a steel barrier.)

Viewing Donald Trump in light of the fascists of the first half of the twentieth century ??who used economic stresses to scapegoat others, created cults of personality, intimidated opponents, incited violence, glorified their nations and disregarded international law, told big lies, and connected directly with the masses ??helps explain what Trump is doing and how he is succeeding.

It also suggests why Donald Trump presents such a profound danger to the future of America and the world.",,10/03/2016 00:00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Southern California law enforcement officials are cautioning against the passage of a statewide ballot initiative that would legalize recreational marijuana, saying it will not put a stop to criminal activity.

?œI don?™t think that Redlanders or Californians should fool themselves that somehow this is going to take away all of the issues, stigma and problems associated with marijuana,??said Mark Garcia, who is a member of the California Police Chiefs Association, which is one of 97 organizations, politicians and community members opposing the measure.

?œThey?™re taking an active role in trying to inform people about what the potential risks of this type of legislation are,??Garcia said. ?œIn partnership with them we?™ll be doing more to try to educate the public on this and some other issues coming up that will not be healthy for our citizens.??
If approved in November, Proposition 64 would allow Californians 21 and older to possess up to an ounce of marijuana and grow as many as six plants. The measure would prohibit driving while impaired, giving cannabis to minors or consuming it in public. It also includes provisions for licensing, testing, labeling, advertising and local control over marijuana businesses.

But some public safety officials contend the measure doesn?™t go far enough to drive out illicit sales, keep roads safe and protect young people.

Garcia said legalization would likely lead to an increase in traffic-related incidents, similar to what has been experienced in Washington and Colorado. He also expects Redlands and the rest of the state would see an increase in robberies, both of marijuana itself and the large sums of cash typically kept on hand by people in the marijuana business.

?œI would expect that those types of thefts or burglaries would still occur,??Garcia said. ?œJust because it?™s legal does not mean people won?™t try to illegally obtain it.??
The anti-Proposition 64 Coalition for Responsible Drug Policies has raised $159,150. Proponents of legalization have raised $6.5 million, with about three months to go before the Nov. 8 election.

The legalization effort lists 112 endorsers, including some law enforcement organizations, such as the National Latino Officers Association, Blacks in Law Enforcement of America and Law Enforcement Against Prohibition. Likewise, it includes a number of public safety leaders, though most who are speaking out in favor of marijuana are retired.

A solid majority of Californians seem to agree with Proposition 64 advocates. A May survey by the Public Policy Institute of California found 60 percent of likely voters support legalization.

?œIt?™s time for law enforcement to admit that the drug war has been a failure,??said Nick Morrow, a former Los Angeles County Sheriff?™s Department deputy who?™s advocating for Proposition 64. ?œMarijuana is not going to go away if you do nothing. I don?™t see the rationale in not regulating it.??
Garcia and others in the public safety community disagree.

?œJust regulating it doesn?™t mean you?™re going to take away all the problems associated with it,??he said.

Garcia pointed to two June shootings at medical marijuana dispensaries in Riverside and San Bernardino. A few months ago, two medical marijuana delivery businesses were robbed in Redlands, he said.

The city prohibits medical marijuana dispensaries and delivery in the city, but it is difficult keeping delivery businesses out.

?œWhat ends up happening is people come from outside the city where maybe one is allowed or they?™re doing it covertly and delivering inside the city,??he said. ?œIt?™s very difficult to catch people doing those type of things.??
Legalizing marijuana will generate significant tax revenue, but public safety officials are divided over whether California will come out ahead in the end.

Proposition 64 establishes a 15 percent sales tax, plus a tax by weight for growers. The Legislative Analyst?™s Office estimates that will generate up to $1 billion each year, which will be directed to cover the cost of the program, invest in research, offset environmental impacts and boost law enforcement.

The LAO also reports that California law enforcement and justice systems might save $100 million each year if Proposition 64 passes, since minor possession would be legal and penalties reduced on a number of marijuana-related crimes.

Whether legalization would be a strain on Police Department resources, Garcia said, would depend on the opening of dispensaries in the city. But, Garcia said, it is unlikely that taxes generated from legal marijuana sales would cover the resources needed to address an increase in traffic-related deaths, accidents and medical assistance.

?œI don?™t think even if we were to do that here that it would be something that would pay for it,??Garcia said. ?œIt would cost us more resources than we would gain.??
Both sides argue that their biggest concern is keeping young people away from marijuana.

Garcia said the proposition?™s ban on advertising marijuana within 1,000 feet of K-12 schools does not apply to colleges, such as the University of Redlands, where 75 percent of the students are under the age of 21. It also would not keep marijuana out of the hands of minors, he said.

Another point of contention is how legalization will impact California?™s multibillion-dollar black market.

If marijuana is regulated under Proposition 64, proponents say revenue would be shifted from violent drug cartels and street gangs to licensed California business owners.

?œIf you don?™t support intelligent regulation, you?™re supporting the cartels,??Morrow said.

But a number of law enforcement leaders reject that notion.

San Bernardino County District Attorney Mike Ramos said the initiative to legalize marijuana ?œwill do nothing to curb black market activity in California.??
Ramos and others point to a paragraph in the 62-page measure that ensures entrepreneurs in the recreational market wouldn?™t be turned down for a business license due to prior felony convictions for controlled substances.

Advocates say that provision means longtime medical marijuana business owners can?™t be shut out of an expanded market based on crimes that would no longer be felonies under the new legal standards.

But John Lovell, a longtime lobbyist for law enforcement groups, said: ?œWhat is incredible about this provision is that it says, ?˜We don?™t care if you?™re a cocaine dealer or a heroin dealer. You can?™t be denied a license because of that.??
Even with public opinion swaying in favor of legalization, law enforcement remains one of the most influential voices when it comes to debating issues such as marijuana legalization, according to Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC. And their credibility doesn?™t seem to have declined, he said, despite recent controversies surrounding the relationship of police and community.

But marijuana legalization advocates have so far collected 40 times more campaign cash than opponents. And with fewer Republican leaders in California who can help raise money for causes backed by men and women in blue, Schnur wonders if law enforcement?™s anti-pot megaphone will be big enough to be heard by voters.

?œUnless the opposition is able to identify a very generous funding source, it?™s difficult to see how they get their message out in a way that allows them to move public opinion,??he said.

Even though Nicki Minaj is happy with the statue are you saying that we should lack standards because she does?

There is absolutely nothing they could say to Ben Shapiro that would actually address any of his arguments. Why would they? Nothing the left believes is actually true. 

Instead they will block the doors to make sure those interested cannot get in, pull the fire alarm, and attempt to put him up against leftist speakers as well. 

In his speech, ""he explained that there are three kinds of diversity: diversity of color, diversity of values, and diversity of ideas. Only the last kind, he said, was valuable to society and could create stable and healthy communities.""

That is what Disdain for Plebs is. We all have similar values but different ideas. Similar values are what is necessary for a stable, prosperous society but that is no longer the case anymore.

Yes.,"I am giving Justice Sotomayor a standing ovation for her courageous and candid dissent from the Supreme Court's decision to uphold yet another routine violation of the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.  She writes as a former prosecutor and says in dissent:

""Do not be soothed by the opinion?™s technical language: This case allows the police to stop you on the street, demand your identification, and check it for outstanding traffic warrants?”even if you are doing nothing wrong . . . .

""[T]his case tells everyone, white and black, guilty and innocent, that an officer can verify your legal status at any time. It says that your body is subject to invasion while courts excuse the violation of your rights. It implies that you are not a citizen of a democracy but the subject of a carceral state, just waiting to be cataloged. . . .

""We must not pretend that the countless people who are routinely targeted by police are 'isolated.' They are the canaries in the coal mine whose deaths, civil and literal, warn us that no one can breathe in this atmosphere. They are the ones who recognize that unlawful police stops corrode all our civil liberties and threaten all our lives. Until their voices matter too, our justice system will continue to be anything but.""

THIS is what truth and justice sounds like in a court of law.  I pray one day these words find their way into a majority opinion rather than calling out to us in dissent from the highest court in the land. For now, let me just say thank you.  Thank you, Justice Sotomayor.  Thank you for speaking truth from a position of power.",21/06/2016 00:00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MINNEAPOLIS ??Five people have been shot near the site of an ongoing protest over the fatal shooting of a black man by a police officer, a Minneapolis Police Department spokesman said.

Spokesman John Elder told The Associated Press in an email just before midnight Monday that five people were shot. All five have injuries that are not life-threatening, he said.

The Star Tribune reported the shootings occurred near an alley about a block away from the 4th Precinct station, where protesters have been conducting a sit-in since the shooting of 24-year-old Jamar Clark on Nov. 15.

Police department Deputy Chief Medaria Arradondo told the newspaper three gunshot victims were taken to a hospital.

No further details were immediately available. It wasn't clear if a suspect or suspects were in custody.

Oluchi Omeoga, who has been participating in protests since last Monday, witnessed the incident.

Protesters saw three people wearing masks who ""weren't supposed to be there,"" Omeoga said. Eventually, the three people left the crowd and began walking down the street, and a few protesters followed. When they reached a corner, the three people pulled out weapons and gunshots rang out, Omeoga said.

Miski Noor, a spokeswoman for Black Lives Matter Minneapolis, said she arrived at the precinct about five to 10 minutes after the shooting. She said police had put up tape around the shooting scene and the crowd was going in size.

Authorities have said Clark was shot during a struggle with police after he interfered with paramedics who were trying to assist an assault victim. But some people who said they saw the shooting allege Clark was handcuffed.

Protesters and Clark's family have been calling for investigators to release video of the shooting. The state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said it has video from the ambulance, a mobile police camera and other sources, but none of it shows the event in its entirety. The agency, which is conducting a state investigation, said releasing the footage now would taint its investigation.

A federal criminal civil rights investigation is also underway, to determine whether police intentionally violated Clark's civil rights through excessive force.

In those 35 years we built the largest middle class in the history of the world and created opportunities for the poor to move upward. In the 35 years since 1980 we?™ve done the opposite. 

1. Between 1945 and 1980: American incomes rose as the economy grew. Since 1980: American incomes have flattened although the economy has continued to grow.

2. Then: Typical CEO of large company got 20x the pay of the typical worker. Now: CEOs get 300x the typical worker?™s pay. 

3. Then: The richest 1 percent got 9 percent of the nation?™s total income. Now: The richest 1 percent get 20 percent. 

4. Then: The marginal tax rate on top incomes was 70 percent. Now: The top marginal rate is 39 percent. 

5. Then: A third of workers in the private sector were unionized. Now: Fewer than 7 percent are.

6. Then: The biggest 5 Wall Street banks had 5% of all banking assets. Now: They have 44%.

7. Then: We expanded free public higher education. Now: Public university tuition is rising faster then inflation.

8. Then: We passed the Voting Rights Acts. Now:  The Supreme Court has gutted the Voting Rights Act and southern states are making it harder for blacks to vote. 

9. Then: We passed the Civil Rights Act and desegregated our schools. Now: Public schools are more racially segregated than they were then. 

10. Then: We built the interstate highway system, the largest public infrastructure project in American history. Now: We?™re investing a smaller share of the economy in infrastructure than at any time since World War II.

""Dear SJW Leftists who make up new ?œphobias??on a bi-weekly basis,

I know it?™s super popular right now to call everything racism. This morning I put a bit of milk into my coffee. I made it ?œless black.??Racism. Who am I to whitewash my coffee? I?™m calling the ACLU to get me into a reeducation program. #BlackCoffeeMatters.

If you think that?™s going down the rabbit hole of ?œthat makes zero sense??then congratulations, you?™ve grasped my point. Islam is a belief system, it isn?™t a race. Being alarmed by the tenants of that belief system doesn?™t make me a ?œracist??anymore than putting cream in my coffee makes me a white supremacist. Plus, I often drink tea instead. Of course, that?™s only to assert my privilege over the historically problematic Indian tea trade, but I digress.

Now we?™ve established everyone who says ?œbeing against Islam makes you a racist,??is two sashays away from being a retard, we can move on to debunking the more recent accusation: ?œIslamophobia.??Side note: CAIR has an entire website dedicated to Islamophobia. CAIR, by the way? They?™re terrorist sympathizers. Yes really. We call that a ?œconflict of interest.??
Before we move onto the funny, let?™s do a little etymological exercise. For those of you who?™ve been educated by a Teacher?™s Union foot soldier (or if you were too busy being molested by one), that means we?™re going to discuss what the word ?œIslamophobia??means.

Islam= one of the three major monotheistic religions (in fact the ?œnewest??monotheistic religion, after Judaism and Christianity) founded in the 7th century AD in the Arabian peninsula. From my dictionary: ?œThe ritual observances and moral code of Islam were said to have been given to Muhammad as a series of revelations, which were codified in the Koran.??Islam is also well-known for its mistreatment of women, the belief that infidels (non-Muslims) must die, and a tendency for factions of Islam to blow people up. Not anecdotal evidence, but purely observable, substantiated data. Allahu Akbar, b**ches.

The Cincinnati Enquirerplaced public records with several schools in Ohio about disciplinary incidents and found some terrible things that had been swept under the rug.
In one particularly shocking case, Pamela Bullock, a Wayne Local Schools intervention specialist, was investigated for mistreatment of special education students.
Bullock purportedly belittled students with racial comments, removed the safety wheels from the wheelchair of another student and threw a marker at another?™s head.
The day Bullock allegedly threw the marker at the student, ?œa racial comment was directed toward the same student,??assistants wrote in a letter that detailed her mistreatment, according to the Enquirer.
?œAfter applying a bandage to the student?™s leg, (Bullock) said, ?˜Anything else, your highness? ??My people fought for years, so we wouldn?™t have to serve white people like you.?™â€?Her remarks are entirely unfitting and beyond shocking as this child did nothing to deserve this kind of treatment.
Since the news of the report, Bullock has resigned from her position ??and not a moment too soon (H/T EAGnews). She should have been fired long ago.

We are all human.   Hatred, bigotry, murder is a HUMAN disease.   

It is experienced by the wealthiest 1% and the poorest 1%.  In the all white neighborhood and the black or immigrant neighborhood.  East and west, farm or city, north and south, left and right.

We must find our way to one another.   

I will fight for HUMAN RIGHTS, because I do not have anymore rights than you and you must have all of mine and I, yours.  Why narrow rights down?     

""Equal rights!"" should be our rallying cry!

The only race that I will both defend and condemn is the human race.   

The color of your skin doesn't matter nor does mine.

I think Penn Jillette is more honorable than some Who claim to be people of faith.   

I will argue that my daughter should not have to share a bathroom with a man who claims to ""feel"" like a woman, but I will defend his right to live his/her life as he chooses and I will stand in front of him if someone chooses to persecute him.

I am Mormon, but should they come for the Catholic, then ""I am Catholic.""

Come for the Jew and I am a Jew.""

Slaughter the peaceful Palestinian and ""I am Palestinian.""

The Muslims who are crying out to us and our government for help in their own American communities are being silenced by those who wish to control them both Muslim and American.  Both left and right.

I will not condemn all Muslims as I would not condemn all Germans in WW2.  Nor as we did with the Japanese Americans and put them in concentration camps.

However, I will always speak the truth.   

Islam as practiced by the majority of Muslims in the Arab world, who embrace Shariah law is evil and a plague on mankind, woman, children, gay, Muslim and not.

These things will take greater courage to say out loud as each day passes with the majority of Americans remaining silent and our political parties and media so ""misguided.""

Lies, fear, manipulation, thirst for power do not belong to one political
Party over another.  Nor one race, class or creed over another.

Totalitarian tendencies, corruption, and a twisting of God is not in one religion and not others.

All of these things are part of the human race.

With honor, courage, love, honesty, humility, character, faith in something bigger than oneself and a lot of hard choices and work we can overcome what we suffer from.

But only if we unite and help one another.  If we look for the best in others and expect it from ourselves.   

If we turn the other cheek while standing firm in the truth;  if we dismiss easy answers and make the difficult choices, we will make it.

It will not be easy or popular, but the cure is simple.

I will stand in your defense. 
I will comfort you in the storm.
I will make your plight mine as we are all human and an injustice toward you is an injustice to me.

Taking a stand really only matters when you link arms with those who don't share your own viewpoints or lifestyle.

That is when it is hard and when it makes a real difference.

I cannot unite, however, with those who do not share the same principles and values.

I value Truth, Liberty, Life and the right of each of us to be sovereign in our own lives.

Those who wish to destroy those values I will stand against you and be immovable even if I stand alone.

But if you share the same values even if our ideas, lifestyles, faith or policies are radically different, I will proudly stand with and for you. 

Will you join me?

1.81135E+11,Law Enforcement Today,181135410243_10156474574570244,"Don't mess with Texas, where law is hard, mistakes common","Don't mess with Texas, where law is hard, mistakes common

Among the 3,000 counties that make up the United States, there is one in Texas where it's best not to mess with the law, because justice is hard and mistakes are common.

Harris County has executed a record 125 people since the US Supreme Court overturned the death penalty in 1976.

""The best answer I know is that it's a huge county -- four million people -- that's very conservative, in an active death penalty state, and for a long time had a notoriously blood thirsty DA,"" Samuel Gross of the University of Michigan law school told AFP.

Home to the sprawling city of Houston, Harris County accounts for nine percent of all modern US executions.

It has executed more people than that any of the 31 states which administer the death penalty, except for the state of Texas as a whole.

""There are four major reasons why Harris County has put so many people on death row: overzealous prosecutors, poor legal representation, racial bias, and the absence of a life without parole sentencing option until 2005,"" said Robert Dunham, director of the Death Penalty information Center.

Studies have shown that Harris County prosecutors were three times more likely to seek the death penalty against African Americans than against white defendants between 1992 and 1999. Juries there were more than twice as likely to impose death sentences on African Americans during the same period.

Lawyers for Duane Buck, sentenced to die in Harris County in 1997, filed an appeal with the Supreme Court Thursday because an expert witness told jurors he posed a higher risk of recidivism because he was black.

- Pleading guilty, even if innocent -

Harris County also accounted for a third of the nation's exoneration cases in 2015, according to a study Gross published Wednesday.

Many of those who spent years behind bars until they could prove their innocence are African Americans like Alfred Brown, who was arrested in 2003 at the age of 21 for a double homicide and sentenced to death in 2005.

Prosecutors suppressed phone records showing Brown was at his girlfriend's home at the time of the crime and jailed his girlfriend on perjury charges until she agreed to testify against him, according to a series of columns which netted Houston Chronicle reporter Lisa Falkenberg a Pulitzer Prize.

Brown was released in June after 12 years behind bars.

The vast majority of exonerations are in drug cases where people caught up in the system are pressured to plead guilty because they have little hope of clearing their names.

""It's shocking but it is very common,"" said Jim Cohen, a professor at Fordham Law School.

""They are pushed by the prosecutor and they are pushed by the defense attorney because the defense attorney is saying, 'if you don't plead guilty and you are convicted after trial, you're going to get a much bigger sentence'.""

But the evidence which pushed them to confess was often flawed or even inadmissible.

The field tests used by police in Harris County and elsewhere in the nation are ""notoriously unreliable,"" and ""routinely misidentify everything from Jolly Ranchers (candies) to chalk to motor oil as illegal drugs,"" the University of Michigan report said.

""They are inadmissible as evidence in court but sufficient to justify an arrest and they may convince an innocent defendant that she is bound to be convicted at trial.""

Some of those who plead guilty might have thought the pills or powders they were carrying contained illegal drugs when they did not, the study concluded.

Others, especially those with previous convictions who could not afford to post bail, agreed to ""attractive plea bargains"" rather than risking years in prison.

An NYPD commander who was grilled by the FBI and saw boxes of records seized by Internal Â­Affairs cops amid a widening corruption probe put a gun to his head and killed himself on Long Island Friday, sources said.

Inspector Michael Ameri, 44, head of the Highway District, ?œfelt his career was in jeopardy??as the feds and the Internal Affairs Bureau eyed unauthorized escorts for members of the Â­Orthodox Jewish community, the sources said.

?œThey went to his station house [Thursday] to get the escort logs. After that, someone called him,??a law-enforcement said, referring to the unit?™s facility off the Grand Central Parkway in Queens.

IAB cops took two years??worth of police-escort files in the raid.

?œHe was very distraught about the visit. He felt his career was in jeopardy, and he couldn?™t deal with the stress and not knowing when everything was going to come to a head,??another source said.

Ameri, the divorced father of a teenage boy, was found dead in his department-issued black Ford Taurus at 12:42 p.m. by Suffolk County homicide cops alongside Bergen Point Golf Course in West Babylon, about four miles from his house, sources said.

The day before his suicide, Ameri got a phone call from the head of his police union, Roy Richter, who tried to reassure him that he shouldn?™t be so worried ??that the IAB visit was focused mostly on a lieutenant who had just put in retirement papers. The lieutenant, one of Ameri?™s closest friends, was cleared for retirement on Friday.

?œI told him that he was not in any type of employment jeopardy,??Richter told The Post. ?œThere was always that fear and concern and that worry. I thought I put those fears and concerns to rest. It?™s obvious I didn?™t.??
Investigators are examining whether cops provided police Â­escorts for funerals and other events in exchange for cash and gifts ??including from businessmen Jona Rechnitz and Jeremy Reichberg.

It was not clear whether damning evidence had been found on Ameri, a 23-year veteran, but he is one of several cops assigned to the unit who were grilled by the FBI about the alleged escorts.

A source said a spooked Ameri had recently distanced himself from Brooklyn?™s Orthodox Jewish community. ?œRight before the Jewish holidays, Ameri told people close to him that he was very worried about the probe,??the source said, ?œand he cut ties with people who the feds were looking at, namely [Alex] ?˜Shaya??Lichtenstein.

?œHe actually told a high-ranking officer in the highway division to stay away from Shaya, cut off all communication.??
Lichtenstein, a Borough Park Shomrim patrol leader, was Â­arrested by the feds on April 17 on charges that he paid off cops for gun permits.

Richter, head of the Captains Endowment Association, called Ameri an excellent cop.

?œWe are heartbroken at the loss of Michael Ameri and ask that you keep his family in your prayers during this traumatic time. Inspector Ameri is known as a dedicated police officer who excelled in all of his command Â­assignments,??Richter said.

A statement released by the NYPD did not discuss Ameri?™s career or the investigation, just details about the suicide. It referred questions to Suffolk cops.

?œThe Suffolk County Police Department will be conducting an investigation and we refer you to them for any further details about this incident,??the statement said.

Ameri was named commanding officer of the patrol unit, which investigates serious accidents, in May 2014.

Previously, he was commanding officer of the 78th Precinct in Park Slope, where he was friendly with Mayor de Blasio, who lived in the neighborhood.

Ameri was considered a key player in implementing de Blasio?™s Vision Zero program to Â­reduce traffic deaths.

?œWe are saddened to learn of the passing of Inspector Michael Ameri. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time,??de Blasio said.

No one was home at the cop?™s residence in West Babylon Friday evening.

Investigators are looking at the escort allegations along with other potential corruption, including accusations that cops took cash for expediting gun permits and accepted lavish gifts from Rechnitz and Reichberg. Among the alleged gifts was a flight to Las Vegas ??with a hooker on board.

At the same time Lichtenstein was allegedly bribing officers in Brooklyn?™s gun-licensing division, two NYPD cops abruptly retired from the unit to start a business helping people get pistol permits.

Another cop was stripped of his gun and badge after he tried to retire last month, prompting his suspension because he was still a target of the feds??probe.

Days before, Laxamana?™s father Jeff had reportedly punished her for an unspecified transgression by cutting off her hair and uploading a video to YouTube. There?™s now a controversy brewing","Izabel Laxamana, a 13-year-old girl in Tacoma, Washington died by suicide after jumping off a highway overpass on Friday, May 29. Days before, Laxamana?™s father Jeff had reportedly punished her for an unspecified transgression by cutting off her hair and uploading a video to YouTube. There?™s now a controversy brewing online and among the girl?™s friends and family over whether the video caused her death.
Tacoma?™s News Tribune reports that the girl, who they don?™t identify by name, exited a car andjumped off a bridge onto Interstate 5. She was taken to a Seattle hospital, where she died on Saturday. Friends of the Laxamana family are now raising money for funeral costs on a GoFundMe site.
The original 15-second video that is supposedly of Izabel, filmed by her father, has been removed. But one of Laxamana?™s friends shared it by taping the original on his phone:

The video opens with a shot of a short-haired girl in a black t-shirt staring blankly at the camera, in what appears to be a garage.
?œThe consequences of getting messed up, man, you lost all that beautiful hair,??a male voice can be heard saying from behind the camera. The video pans down, where long locks of black hair are scattered on the ground. ?œWas it worth it????œNo,??she responds quietly.
?œHow many times did I warn you???he asks.
?œA lot,??she replies, barely audibly.
After Izabel?™s death, a blog called Tacoma Stories claimed that the public shaming led to her suicide and constituted abuse:

Public shaming is a form of abuse. There are those who will say that it teaches a lesson. So does punching someone in the face. That doesn?™t make it okay to do to your children. My thoughts are with this young girl. I hope that she gets the help she needs. I also hope her father gets the help he so clearly needs and that her family can heal from these traumatic events brought on by public shaming.

The blog?™s author, John Cameron, added in an update that he?™d closed the comments section ?œdue to multiple requests from family members of the victim.??A Facebook page called Justice for Izabel is filled with calls for her father to be criminally prosecuted or else publicly shamed himself.
While the social media mob is busy coming for Laxamana?™s family, it?™s also important to note that determining cause and effect when it comes to suicide isn?™t easy. We have little information about what else was going on in Laxamana?™s life, although in a Google Plus post from last year, she writes about feeling bullied at school. She shares a link to a song and says it?™s what gets her through her tough times:

I feel hated most of the time im in school i feel looked down on and i get judged alot?? But what keeps me going is people like kian who have gone through the same thing as me??In a school with so many people its weird to say ?œi feel alone??but the truth is that you really do feel alone. So thanks for everything kian??

Outside Giaudrone Middle School, someone else filmed the enormous pile of flowers, stuffed animals and chalk messages that have been left by students in tribute to Laxamana:

The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If you?™re in crisis or feeling suicidal, please call 1-800-273-8255. You can also chat online with someone from NSPL at any time, day or night.

Special guest, Michael Imhotep from the film ""Resurrecting Black Wall Street"" and founder of The African History Network.  We hope that people come out from all over the DMV to see this film and check out Baltimore's own Watoto From the Nile, who will be providing the theme song for this documentary. This event will be held at the Beautiful and Historic, Senator Theatre.

Here is a brief summary of the film:

Before Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was murdered by the government, he?™d begun to explore the deep impact that economic inequality had on his ability to affect social change. Dr. King found that, if we do not address financial wrongs of the past, we will not be able to fulfill the dream that many of us share today.

?œResurrecting Black Wall Street: The Blueprint??examines Little Africa of Tulsa Oklahoma in 1921 as a shining example of what black people can accomplish when we pursue our economic goals as a collective. Featuring leading financial scholars, historians and activists, the film allows us to study the body of knowledge left behind by our ancestors in order to move on to a more empowered future.

Lt. Gen. Petersen made history when he became the first African-American Marine Corps general officer and Marine Corps general. He retired in 1988 as the commanding general at the Marine Corps Combat Development Command at Quantico, Virginia.

None of his achievements came easy. His journey was fraught with hardships from the start.

For almost 70 years, Lucy Parsons fought for the rights of the poor and disenfranchised in the face of an increasingly oppressive economic system. Parson's radical activism challenged the racist and sexist sentiment in a time when even radical Americans believed that a woman's place was in the home.

In the mid-1870s, Lucy Parson became involved in many political organizations, including the Socialist Labor Party of America (SLP). Over time she became more radical, joining the International Working People?™s Association, an anarchist organization and later on the radical trade union Industrial Workers of the World. When she saw the anarchist movement had no future as it no longer actively moved the people toward revolution, she began working with the Communist Party where she played an important role in the campaign for the Scottsboro Boys. Unwavering in her belief that the government should be dismantled and capitalism should be overthrown, she fought for those goals until her death.",,29/03/2016 00:00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ST. LOUIS (AP) ??A gunman wearing a bandanna over his face opened fire on a uniformed St. Louis police sergeant before dawn Tuesday, peppering his windshield with at least a dozen rounds, and the police chief credited the officer's body armor with saving his life.

Police Chief Sam Dotson said the officer sustained a torso injury not considered life-threatening during the hail of gunfire on his private vehicle shortly before 5 a.m. in the city's tony Central West End neighborhood. Dotson called the attack a ""brazen act of violence.""

The officer, who was working security as a second job, managed to return fire and believes he may have wounded one of the four men who occupied the car from which the gunman emerged, Dotson said.

The officer and the four suspects are black, police said.

""They targeted, they ambushed, they tried to assassinate a police officer,"" the chief told reporters outside the hospital where the officer was being treated and was expected to be released later Tuesday. ""What we saw tonight are individuals that were armed, that targeted a police officer and had no second thoughts, no remorse about it at all.""

""What we saw today are guns in the hands of criminals and their willingness to use them,"" Dotson said.

Dotson said the officer had been monitoring three people walking down the street, but did not engage them before they left the area.

Moments later, a silver or gray vehicle occupied by four people, including the walkers, pulled up in front of the sergeant's car, Dotson said. The gunman stepped out and began firing at the officer, then fled on foot as the suspect's car sped away.

The wounded officer drove after the gunman but lost sight of him in a parking garage, Dotson said, crediting the officer's ballistic vest for saving his life.

Investigators planned to obtain footage from an abundance of surveillance cameras in the area, Dotson said.

He did not release the injured officer's name but said he is a 16-year veteran of the force.

e-int, Arizona Republic

Advancing Celebrity Theatre, July 1
1.  Ted you're launching your Sonic Baptizm tour in Phoenix. What can you tell me about the tour? 
NUGE-I can tell you that if I wasn't in this band, Id travel the globe to witness this soulmusic outrage! Greg Smith on bass and young Jason Hartless from Detroit on thunderDrums create the dream rhythm slam every guitarplayer dreams of every song, every night, every gig, every jam. We are so tight and powerful I would like to apologize in advance. Bo Diddly, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, James Brown and the mighty Motown Funkbrothers are alive in this band. We're like unleashed breeding animals with loud instruments and too much spirit and attitude. We're having so much fun performing my amazing songs it is inescapable.

2. What appealed to you about that tour name and what does it to mean to be baptized by Ted Nugent? 
NUGE-Brilliant thoughts flow with a life of their own to a dedicated reasoning predator up in a tree with a bow and arrow half the year meditating soulfully in anticipation to kill unsuspecting meat infested herbivores. Seriously, I was musically baptized by the black founding fathers of rock-n-roll and like all real music lovers, the music changed, enriched, upgraded and fortified our lives forever. My concerts and my music do this to people.

3. How do you and your bandmates go about preparing for the tour? I understand it involves more sportsmanship than a lot of other artists' tour rehearsals? 
NUGE-We certainly jam relentlessly to get as tight and powerful as humanly possible, but the music is augmented by small arms fire, archery, some shared spiritual campfire time storytelling and of course the daily sacred venison and wild boar grilling celebration. The whole procedure is crazy fun beyond belief. 

4. What's the best part of touring for you at this point? 
NUGE-Always has been and always will be the shared exuberant shared love of the music.

5. Your shows have obviously gotten more political these past few decades. Did something in particular inspire you to move the shows in that direction. 
NUGE-The heartbreak of runaway corruption, abuse of power and indefensible criminality by our government and media should, must inspire all good we the people Americans to wake the hell up from the embarrassing curse of apathy and start demanding Constitutional accountability from our elected employees. How radically non-sheep of me. The spirit of America is all about defiance and the best music like mine is the freedom soundtrack. Don't tread on me.

6. Was there any concern on your part that some fans who came because they love your music might not share your political views, that they'd rather you Shutup & Jam as you titled your latest release? 
NUGE-No. Even soulless wimps love killer music and my incredible guitar tone.

7. Could you enjoy a concert by an artist on the left who was as vocal as you've been about what he or she believes? I know a lot of rock fans on the right are annoyed when artists like Bruce Springsteen share their political views. 
NUGE-Sure. I'm militantly anti-drug abuse but love everything Keith Richards and some other drug goofballs do. Green Day is politically braindead but I love the little monkeys. Music is the great connector. Of the millions and millions of my facebookers I get the occasional ultra-lefty that hates my politics but knows killer music and dedication when they see and hear it.

8. I know you've been a very vocal Trump supporter and it is a big election year. If you had a chance to talk an undecided voter into Donald Trump, what would you say?
NUGE- I say it all the time; Trump represents the ultimate anti-status quo suckerpunch. Bernie and Hillary are all about bribing gullible losers to vote for the big scam that they can get other's earnings all the while making America weaker and weaker. How pathetic.

9. You've said ?œI like Donald Trump because he is bold and he is treating the culture war as the culture war that it is.??Could you talk a bit about the culture war and what it means to you and also what you think a guy like Donald Trump could do about it? 
NUGE-Lord have mercy, I could Gone with the Wind on this answer, but I will keep it simple and concise. The culture war in America can best be described by the battle between workin hard playin hard shitkickers that bust our ass to make America strong by earning our own way and kickin maximum ass versus soulless weaklings who have been brainwashed into thinking they are entitled to a free ride. What the hell is social justice? What sort of fool can imagine income equality as dictated by bureaucrats and government thugs? I dare anyone to attempt to explain those drug inspired fantasies in meaningful terms. There are multi-scatterings of various and associated issues and concerns, but it all boils down to accountable people versus those unwilling to be accountable. Absolutely heartbreaking. 

10. What do you think are the biggest misperceptions people have about Ted Nugent in 2016?- 
NUGE-There aren't really any actual misperceptions, just dumb people versus good, honest people. Those that are goofy enough to believe the outrageous lies and hate spewed about me in the mind numb media are inconsequential and pathetic. Those that know me are certain of my goodness and connect with me deeply. For the umpteenth time today again, I received letters from families whose children attend my Ted Nugent Kamp for Kids charity events and how I had a powerful positive influence on their young sons and daughters for the past 25 years. I also received another communication from the family of a great man who died of cancer and considered me his BloodBrother and how my FRED BEAR song was his anthem and would be played at his memorial. I also got another letter from the family of a US Military hero who died for his country and how he looked up to me and how they would also play FRED BEAR at his memorial. I also got a video from Marcus Luttrell telling me he looks up to me as his hero. My haters are laughable punks, my supporters the greatest people that ever lived. The families who chose me to take their terminally ill kids on their last hunts in life many times over the years know and love the real Ted Nugent. That they decide I'm good enough to take part in such a spiritual and emotional moment in their lives proves that I am good enough. Period.",,24/06/2016 00:00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

?œThe struggle for justice should never be abandoned because of the apparent overwhelming power of those who have the guns and the money and who seem invisible in their determination to hold onto it. That apparent power has, again and again, proved vulnerable to moral fervor, determination, unity, organization, sacrifice, wit, ingenuity, courage, patience ??whether by blacks in Alabama and South Africa, peasants in El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Vietnam, or workers and intellectuals in Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union itself.??

1.31004E+14,America Secede or Die,131004177063779_478777832286410,Gun Test: Smith &#038; Wesson M&#038;P9L Pro Series C.O.R.E.,I may be getting me one of these in the near future. Looks like a great weapon!,"Given the success of the striker-fired Smith & Wesson Military & Police (M&P)-series handguns, line extensions were virtually assured.
The most innovative variation to emerge, though, did so in 2013 with the introduction of the Competition Optics Ready Equipment (C.O.R.E.), also available in the Pro Series configuration evaluated here.
As its name suggests, the C.O.R.E. was created to ease installation and removal of an optic, depending on regulations for the user?™s specific organization or competition.

There are myriad reasons for adding an optical sight to a semi-automatic competition handgun, but certainly faster target acquisition and difficulty aligning (or even seeing) iron sights due to aging eyes top the list. Moreover, sans magnification, small, reflex-style sights permit increased situational awareness, both-eyes-open shooting and easier target engagement in varying lighting conditions. The same attributes would greatly benefit the defensive-minded homeowner.
In its C.O.R.E.-series handguns, S&W devised a fairly simple approach for affixing an optic; simply choose the correct steel optic-mounting plate and install it in the recess immediately forward of the rear sight. The optic is then mounted directly atop the plate. Included with each C.O.R.E. pistol are five bases (and the necessary screws) that accommodate six popular competition sights:Trijicon RMR; Leupold Deltapoint; JPoint; Doctor; C-More STS; and InSight MRDS. There?™s also a polymer plate for use when an optic is not desired or permitted. It?™s an ingenious system that requires minimal time to install or remove an optic, and the end result is not the least bit obtrusive. Holsters that work with an optic-equipped M&P C.O.R.E. are available from Blade Tech, 5.11,BlackHawk and CB Kydex Products, among others.
The system also enables co-witnessing of the red dot and the elevated iron sights so that, should the optic?™s battery fail at an inopportune time, the sights are easily acquired. The sights themselves are dovetailed into place and feature the familiar three white-dot picture; the fixed rear unit is secured with a setscrew and has two dots and a 0.140??wide notch, while the dovetailed and drift-adjustable post front sight has a single dot. Lastly, the black, Melonite-coated steel slide has aggressive wave-shaped serrations for improved purchase when racking the slide, as well as a cutout that works in unison with one on the barrel to create a window for checking the chamber?™s status.
The firearm provided for evaluation was the 9 mm Luger-chambered M&P9L Pro Series C.O.R.E., which featured a 5??barrel with five-groove, 1:10??twist rifling, though a 4Â¼??barreled version is available. Both barrel length variants are available in .40 S&W as well. Beneath the barrel is the single recoil spring surrounding a guide rod?”identical to those in the standard M&P-series pistols.
As with prior M&P models, the Pro Series C.O.R.E. features a polymer frame with steel slide rails and three interchangeable, textured backstraps. Exchanging the backstrap is both quick and easy; simply rotate the frame tool one-quarter turn and withdraw it from the bottom of the grip, remove the insert, install the new one, and then replace the frame tool, which secures it in place. The same tool is also used for field stripping the handgun for maintenance. Lastly, there?™s an accessory rail molded into the dust cover for the addition of lasers, lights and other accessories.

The M&PL Pro Series C.O.R.E. pistols have bilateral fire controls. The magazine-release button is reversible, though it comes factory equipped for right-handed shooters, and a slide stop appears on both sides of the gun. The only non-bilateral control is the takedown lever. As for the polymer trigger, it features an articulating section that must be pressed 1/8??rearward to permit the main trigger to move and the gun to fire. The lengthy, double-action movement gives the feeling of a two-stage trigger. The pull weight on our test sample averaged 6 lbs. exactly with zero overtravel and had a very short reset. In short, it?™s a very good trigger as-is for competition. There is no external safety.
The evaluation M&P9L Pro Series C.O.R.E. shipped with two 17-round magazines, making it well-suited for competition. The .40 S&W versions ship with 15-round magazines. Regardless of capacity, the magazines have steel bodies with both witness holes and numerals for counting rounds remaining, as well as polymer baseplates and followers.

For testing, we headed to the range with an assortment of 9 mm Luger ammunition. We were more than impressed with the gun?™s accuracy. In addition, we noted that the M&PL Pro Series C.O.R.E.?™s 5??barrel yielded velocities for the Federal load in excess of the factory-touted number.
With accuracy testing completed, we then fed the M&PL Pro Series C.O.R.E. a hodgepodge of 9 mm Luger loads with varying weights and profiles in random order to determine its reliability. The gun digested everything without a hiccup. Moreover, thanks to the Leupold Deltapoint, during the rapid-fire sessions target acquisition was immediate, and despite firing several hundred rounds, thanks no doubt to the gun?™s 26-oz. heft, there was no discomfort; in fact, it was a pleasant day at the range.

This is a very sad story about a bear...
Everybody should heed the warnings not to feed wildlife
because they become dependent and don't forage for themselves
any longer. It is such a tragedy to see what has been done to
our country's wildlife. The US Forest Service photo below captures a disturbing trend that is beginning to affect U.S. wildlife.
Animals that formerly were self-sufficient are now showing
signs of belonging to the Democrat Party.  They have apparently
learned to just sit and wait for the government to step in and
provide for their care and sustenance. This photo is of a black
bear in Alaska turned Democrat. He's nicknamed Bearack Obearma. It is believed that he has become a campground organizer. A sad, sad situation!

A pastor became so incensed at Rev. Al Sharpton?™s call for donations during a rally against community violence he shouted amid the event: How dare you ask for money at this rally?

The rally was held in Hartford, Connecticut. And there, several speakers touched on the need to come together as a community and stand strong against the rising homicide rate ??among them, Sharpton.
Speeches took a slight deviation from the topic, however, when several on stage mentioned the need for more money for Sharpton?™s National Action Network. Mediaite reported. Sharpton himself at one point said all money raised would be given to the community, and then offered up $1,000.
Apparently, not all in the crowd thought it appropriate the speakers used the anti-violence rally to raise money. At one point, Pastor Marcus Moriah Jarvis shouted from the crowd:?Don?™t you come up in here asking us for money!??He later called Sharpton a ?œpimp??for fueling the money-raising efforts.

The hypocritical nature of BLM is being compared terrorist organisations and Black Lives Matter protests against violence against Black Lives with violence against innocent lives unrelated to unjust killings of two African Americans.

1. Cops killed nearly twice as many whites as blacks in 2015. According to data compiled by The Washington Post, 50 percent of the victims of fatal police shootings were white, while 26 percent were black.

2. More whites and Hispanics die from police homicides than blacks. According to MacDonald, 12 percent of white and Hispanic homicide deaths were due to police officers, while only four percent of black homicide deaths were the result of police officers.

3. Black and Hispanic police officers are more likely to fire a gun at blacks than white officers. 

4. Blacks are more likely to kill cops than be killed by cops. This is according to FBI data, which also found that 40 percent of cop killers are black. According to MacDonald, the police officer is 18.5 times more likely to be killed by a black than a cop killing an unarmed black person.

Despite the facts, the anti-police rhetoric of Black Lives Matter and their leftist sympathisers have resulted in what MacDonald calls the ""Ferguson Effect,"" as murders have spiked by 17 percent among the 50 biggest cities in the U.S. as a result of cops being more reluctant to police neighbourhoods out of fear of being labelled as racists. http://www.wiseyoungman.com/do-you-believe-blm-is-a-domestic-terrorist-organisation.html",WATCH Poll + Video:,09/07/2016 00:00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Byron Thomas, a black student from South Carolina, spoke with CNN?™s Hala Gorani this week regarding the way he views the Confederate flag, and the reporter was noticeably shocked when he stood up for the symbol of the South.
According to the Conservative Tribune:
Thomas explained that he was proud of South Carolina for giving pensions to black troops who fought for the South after the war. He stated that he was proud of his heritage, and his state, and that the flag represents all of that to him.
?œI do not feel offended and I refuse to allow a symbol or word have power over me to make me feel offended,??explained Thomas, who has his own Confederate flag hanging in his room.

Complete media blackout after a very disturbing story is beginning to emerge from California. After the mainstream media refused to pick up the story, well-known anti-Islamic pundit Pamela Geller was determined to get to the bottom of the story after receiving a disturbing report that a group of Muslim men had opened fire on campers and hikers at a state park in California. It happened several days ago at a park in San Bernadino, the same city where 14 people were killed by another Islamic attack by psycho Muslim couple Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik back in December.

The wasp thing is making me think twice about air travel.,"We know that we?™re surrounded by the good, the bad and the completely wonky.
But just when you thought you?™d read it all, we found these 18 facts that sound completely fabricated and crazy, but are true as can be.
So hold on and don?™t call B.S. just yet.
These unbelievable facts will blow your mind, all over again.
1. So far, wasps have brought down 2 commercial airline flights, killing over 200 people.


Mud Dauber is a name commonly applied to a number of wasps, from either the family Sphecidae or Crabronidae, that build their nests from mud.

On September 12, 1980, the ill-fated Florida Commuter Airlines Flight 65 crashed, en route to the Bahamas, killing all 34 passengers and crew. The cause was determined as a malfunctioning air speed indicator, ruined by mud dauber nests that were not cleared properly from the aircraft?™s pilot tubes.
Then, on February 6, 1996, Birgenair Flight 301 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, after a black and yellow mud dauber got into the pilot tube and built its cylindrical nest inside. All 13 crew members and 176 passengers died.


2. A Chinese monk?™s devotion has left a deep mark on a temple in the monastery town of Tongren in Qinghai province. The ageing monk has been kneeling in prayer a 1,000 times each day, for the last 20 years, and his footprints are now etched upon the temple?™s wooden floor.
3. There is a tree named Pando that is technically an entire forest.
It is the clonal colony of 4700 aspen, that all share the same root system. Pando means ?˜I Spread??the tree/forest is also called The Trembling Giant.
4. Scientists in Mexico were able to turn the country?™s spirit of choice, tequila, into diamonds.
This surprise discovery was made when researchers at the National Autonomous University experimented with making ultra-thin films of diamond from organic solutions like acetone and ethanol. The mix that worked best was 40% alcohol and 60% water, very similar to the proportions used in tequila.
This just makes tequila even cooler, don?™t you think?
5. A trained Beagle assistance dog won an award when she called 911 after her owner, who is diabetic, had a seizure and collapsed.
Belle, a 17-pound beagle, became the first canine recipient of the VITA Wireless Samaritan Award. She was able to bite into her owner?™s phone and call 911 when he collapsed.
Thanks to their keen sense of smell, animals like Belle are able to detect abnormalities in a person?™s blood sugar levels. By dialing the emergency number, Belle most definitely saved her owner?™s life.
6. Thanks to technology, you now know how the sun sees you!
Here?™s an amazing video of what people look like with an ultraviolet camera.


7. In 1850, a man named Thomas Austin released 24 rabbits into the wild for sport hunting in Australia. Less than 70 years later, the rabbit population grew to a staggering 10 billion.


The rabbits were reproducing at a rate of 18 to 30 per single female rabbit per year. The reason for this could also be that Australia is the ideal place for rabbits. With mild winters, no threat of predators, natural low vegetation and an abundance of land, Australia proved to be the perfect home for the then new and invasive species.

8. A clever 18-year-old freshman crowdfunded his education by asking 2.8 million people for one penny.
In 1987, chemistry freshman Mike Hayes wrote to Chicago Tribune columnist Bob Greene, asking him to request that each of his readers send Hayes a penny.
Soon, the ?˜Many Pennies for Mike??campaign had the equivalent of 2.3 million pennies to its name. Mike was able to finance his college education, thanks to this quirky scheme, and graduated from the University of Illinois.
9. Penguins can drink salt water!
The supraorbital gland in penguins allows them to drink salt water. The gland performs the function of a filter, which lets them separate the salt from the water.
10. Looking to amp up your walking routine? Not swinging your arms when you walk increases the effort of walking by 12%, the equivalent of walking 20% faster or carrying a 10 kg backpack. Feel those calories melt away!
11. Bill Haast, the ?˜Snake Man?? was bitten by snakes at least 173 times over the course of his 100-year-old life. The secret to his survival was that he injected himself with snake venom every single day for 60 years and built up an immunity to the poison.
However, this did not come easy. He was bitten fatally about 20 times. His hands were disfigured and mangled after close encounters with these poisonous predators.
Over the years, Bill Haast saved many lives. He traveled around the world and donated his antibody-rich blood to 21 snake bite victims.
12. If all the observable stars in the galaxy were divided up among our population, everyone would have 44.1 trillion stars. Just the thought of that makes me happy.
13. Two hours after doctors pronounced him dead, a premature baby was brought back to life by his mother?™s cuddles.


Kate Ogg gave birth to twins ??a boy and a girl ??at 27 weeks. When she was told that her son, who weighed 2 lbs, had not made it, she could not digest what had happened.

She picked him up and pressed him to her chest, told him that his name was Jaime and that he had a little sister and held him close to herself for two hours, when he miraculously started breathing.

14. Nature?™s many mysteries! A species of frog, found in Alaska, completely freezes during the winter. While frozen, the frog stops breathing, its heart stops beating, its blood stops flowing, and it cannot move at all. However, when spring sets in, the frog?™s body thaws and normal life continues.
15. Just a spoonful of matter taken from a neutron star would weigh more that Mt. Everest or 900 pyramids of Giza. That?™s more than 5,500,000,000 mammoth tons.
16. A sheep in China gave birth to a ?˜sheep dog??that sharply resembles a dog and even plays like a hound!
Chinese farmer Liu Naiying was shocked when one of his sheep gave birth to an odd looking creature. The lamb looks a lot like a dog, despite being covered in wool. Mr. Liu admitted he was frightened at first, never having seen anything like this in the 20 years he has been raising sheep.
17. A prison in Brazil uses geese as an alarm system.
An overcrowded prison in Brazil has put in place a rather alarming security detail. It has employed two geese to alert security guards when convicts try to escape, as well as when violence breaks out.
Sobral prison warden Wellington Picanco said that the geese make a lot of noise when they sense ?˜strange movements??
18. The school of your dreams actually exists. The Sudbury Valley School in Massachusetts, U.S., has done away with a prescribed curriculum and does not conduct tests or assign homework. In fact, no classes are held unless they are requested for, by students.
But here?™s what?™s surprising ??82% of these students get accepted to college, as opposed to the 63% national public school average.

Bush, we elected Barack Obama, America's first black President, and now we have Hillary Clinton, who will be the first female President.

No matter which candidate you supported, this is history in the making.

We would never have seen this from the Republican Party. Indeed, they are more obvious than ever in their desire to drag the nation back in time. This could not be personified any better than their Nominee, the racist, misogynistic, ignorant Donald J. Trump.

Historians will study this eight year period of time. How America turned a corner. How America elected its first black President and then it's first female President in a span of only eight years.

It's unprecedented. It's something previously thought impossible. And from now until forever, it will be Democrats, the liberals, the progressives, the hopeful, and the brave, who helped make this happen.

It's a special time in American history. That will be said a lot, going forward.

But it can never be said enough. ~ Chad",,07/06/2016 00:00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7.9954E+14,Shaun King,799539910084929_968094443229474,King: LeBron James' ignorance on Tamir Rice death appalling,"Whoa. When asked about #TamirRice - LeBron James basically said he didn't even know enough about him to speak on it. I feel dumb for being shocked, but this dude is Mr. Cleveland and Tamir was killed 400 days ago. How in the hell could he not know enough about the case?

In the 1960s, Malcolm X was regularly frustrated when people expected black athletes and entertainers to be effective spokesmen on civil rights issues. Back then, and now, it often leads to a whole lot of disappointment. Once in a blue moon the earth gives us a Harry Belafonte or Muhammad Ali, but they are the ultra rare exceptions to the rule.

LeBron James is one of my favorite athletes. The dude has a work ethic on and off the court that is unmatched. His character as a husband and father are unquestioned and he appears to be an incredibly altruistic and generous man. Sadly, with his recent comments on the death of Tamir Rice and the lack of charges for the officers who killed him, LeBron James has proven that he is not an exception to the rule.

As a fan, I am sincerely surprised and highly disappointed in what LeBron said (and didn't say) about the case.

Speaking after a recent game, when asked about Tamir?™s death, LeBron said, ""For me, I've always been a guy who's took pride in knowledge of every situation that I've ever spoke on. And to be honest, I haven't really been on top of this issue. So it's hard for me to comment. I understand that any lives that [are] lost, what we want more than anything is prayer and the best for the family, for anyone. But for me to comment on the situation, I don't have enough knowledge about it.""

This response is wild to me. I sincerely assumed, which was clearly wrong, that LeBron knew all about this case. He left the Miami Heat to return to the Cleveland Cavaliers, in great part because he said he loved the city and wanted to be an active citizen there.

LeBron is a father to two young sons close to Tamir's age. The shooting death and subsequent decision not to prosecute the officers is the most covered news story of police violence in Cleveland?™s history. It has absolutely gripped the nation, but somehow, most of us know about this case and LeBron doesn't.

Listen, I know LeBron isn't Muhammad Ali and I definitely knew he isn't Malcolm X, but for him to basically say he can't even comment on this case because he simply doesn't know enough about it is appalling.

I made the classic mistake that many of us make with celebrities. We impose on them the values and ideals that we wish they had ??with no real evidence that they do. I just assumed that Mr. Cleveland knew and cared enough about Tamir Rice to be able to use his influence and platform to speak on it intelligently.

I was wrong.

I had been hoping for months and months that LeBron was eventually going to say something strong about this case. I imagined he was just looking for that right time. What we've learned now is something as far short as that as humanly possible. He wasn't speaking out about it because he doesn't even know the basics.

It's no wonder that police and prosecutors of Cleveland think they can do whatever they want to black folk in the city and get away with it. The most powerful man in town doesn't even care enough to put even a smidgeon of fear in them.

Ignorance is bliss when it comes to our heroes sometimes. Learning the truth is a mighty huge letdown.

Ready for some weird news? If not, you?™re in the wrong place. And if you?™re a dog-lover then you?™ll probably enjoy hearing what happened to this unfortunate character who met his untimely fate courtesy of a clumsy accident.
The South China Morning Post reported that a black market trader who kept and killed dogs ??which he then sold as dog meat ??died on the way to hospital, after accidentally shooting himself with an poisoned dart.

The incident happened in the Hunan province of South China. The man was demonstrating how to use a crossbow and poisoned dart to slaughter a dog, when he accidentally shot himself. After police were called two the scene, five men were arrested who reportedly admitted to owning a stockpile of over 1,000 frozen dog carcasses.

This news comes amid a social media frenzy surrounding the dog meat festival in Yulin ??an annual celebration of dog cooking and eating. Having become accustomed to not eating dogs in the West, there has been outrage at the annual festival and much campaigning to bring a stop to it. What?™s more harrowing is breeders??and traders??treatment of man?™s best friend while he?™s still alive. Kept in tiny cages and often malnourished, the dogs sell for as little as 85p.

A popular delicacy in rural parts of China, some gangs are said to raid homes to keep up with demand. Hailed by some as part of Chinese culture, dog meat is said to have powerful health benefits. I for one am not willing to test this theory. And whilst it?™s a shame to hear about this unfortunate man?™s demise, I?™m sure dogs everywhere will breathe a sigh of relief.

I think this is enough weird news for me for one day. But if you want something even weirder, check out our piece on live plastic surgery you can now watch via Snapchat. Yum. What?™s for dinner??

Steffon Josie-Davis is a responsible gun owner who wanted to be a police officer. He used to work as an armored guard for armed service company Loomis. When his little sister was playing in the garage where his gun was accessible, Josey-Davis put it inside the glove box of a locked vehicle. Josey-Davis then drove that car before accidentally failing to take the firearm out of the vehicle. His handgun is legally registered in the state of New Jersey.
Hello, My name is Steffon Josey-Davis I?™m a 24 year old from New Jersey who became a convicted felon for a legally owned firearm. As an armored Guard for Loomis, As a Armed service company who transported U.S & foreign currency to banks and service ATM?™s. I was also on the road to a successful career with my township police department.
One Morning on September 20th 2013. I was preparing myself for work, grabbing my firearm out of my safe, bulletproof vest, Making my way to the garage. While in the process of disarming my firearm. My little sister came into the garage. To aviod any accidents, I put the firearm in the glove compartment moments after putting my bulletproof vest on the passanger seat. After securing my firearm, I took my sister upstairs to put her back in bed. Losing track of time, I noticed I was running late, grabbed my keys and continued to leave my house that morning for work. Not realizing my firearm was still in the glove compartment.
When I left out of the house that morning I was later pulled over in my vehicle. During my traffic stop, I notified the officers who I was, Who I worked for and I had my Legally owned firearm in my glove compartment.
The officers took my fire arm and let me go, When I went to claim my fire arm from the police department they arrested me and charged me with unlawful possession of a firearm I legally owned.
I was facing 10 years in prison for a simple technicality. I am now a convicted felon.
When Josie-Davis was pulled over for a minor traffic violation, he immediately informed the officer about the firearm in the vehicle. He thought everything was fine until later he was charged with a felony for transporting a handgun.
?œIt?™s ruined my life basically. Through this whole ordeal I lost everything, my job, my career,??Josey-Davis said during a recent interview on Fox and Friends. ?œI went to the NAACP and they refused to help me and they say black lives matter, but obviously they really don?™t because I didn?™t fit their agenda. And it?™s not fair because my life matters too ya know? Being convicted of a felony is not right and they should be able to help me.???œBasically I?™m not getting shot by a police officer so they?™re not going to come out and defend me,??he said.
?œI?™m out here doing better for myself and trying to provide for my family. My life matters too. I?™m not a criminal whatsoever and they should be helping me just like they help other black young men out there.??Amazing how progressive anti-gun and anti-police political ideology trumps helping those the NAACP claims to stand up for.

https://www.facebook.com/jgunn/posts/10153548508766157","People get upset when something they consider intrinsic to a comic book character changes when adapted for a film. I get this. There are movies I dislike because I think there's a basic misunderstanding of the story or the character when the comic is transferred to film (I still hate how in the first Batman movie the Joker was revealed as the murderer of Bruce Wayne's parents, for instance.)

That said, I do not believe a character is the color of his or her skin. When Michael B Jordan was cast as Johnny Storm I didn't understand the uproar. The primary characteristic of Johnny was not, to me, that he was white, or that he had blonde hair, but that he was a fiery, funny, big-mouthed braggart of a hero. I was happy that he was going to be played by one of the finest and most charming young actors out there.

Yesterday, a rumor broke out that the character of Mary Jane was being played by a young black woman, Zendaya, and all hell broke out on the Internet (again). I tweeted that if people find themselves complaining about Mary Jane's ethnicity they have lives that are too good. (For those of you who think this means I'm confirming that Zendaya IS playing MJ, realize that although I've read the Spidey script, and I've met the actress in question, I have no idea what her role is. There's a good chance someone told me at one time or another, but, if so, I can't remember. I'm going to find out when I go into Marvel this afternoon, but I feel free to speak until that time because it's about the concept about a black woman playing Mary Jane, not the actuality or hypothesis of it.)

I got a thousand or so responses to my tweet. Most of them were positive. Some folks disagreed - they thought the character should look like what she looks like in the comics - but were thoughtful. And a handful were flat out racist.

I can't respond to the racists - I'm not ever going to change their minds.  But for the thoughtful majority of you out there: 

For me, if a character's primary attribute - the thing that makes them iconic - is the color of their skin, or their hair color, frankly, that character is shallow and sucks. For me, what makes MJ MJ is her alpha female playfulness, and if the actress captures that, then she'll work. And, for the record, I think Zendaya even matches what I think of as MJ's primary physical characteristics - she's a tall, thin model - much more so than actresses have in the past. 

Whatever the case, if we're going to continue to make movies based on the almost all white heroes and supporting characters from the comics of the last century, we're going to have to get used to them being more reflective of our diverse present world. Perhaps we can be open to the idea that, although someone may not initially match how we personally conceive a character, we can be - and often are - happily surprised.",20/08/2016 00:00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Full song, ""I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day""

I heard the bells on Christmas Day
Their old, familiar carols play,

and wild and sweet
The words repeat
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!

And thought how, as the day had come,
The belfries of all Christendom

Had rolled along
The unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!

Till ringing, singing on its way,
The world revolved from night to day,

A voice, a chime,
A chant sublime
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!

Then from each black, accursed mouth
The cannon thundered in the South,

And with the sound
The carols drowned
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!

It was as if an earthquake rent
The hearth-stones of a continent,

And made forlorn
The households born
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!

And in despair I bowed my head;
""There is no peace on earth,"" I said;

""For hate is strong,
And mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!""

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:
""God is not dead, nor doth He sleep;

The Wrong shall fail,
The Right prevail,
With peace on earth, good-will to men.""",,11/12/2015 00:00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So our discussions about 'feeling black' and racial identity are all well and good, but this, I think, is what being black in America is REALLY  still like far too often.
We need to retire that Rachel woman and her hair to the dustbin of history and go back to talking about the huge, bleeding, festering wound America has got, and how we are going to deal with it.

#6 Don't applaud black-and-white thinking. 
We need leaders who can see the nuance in situations, who don't collapse the world into simple categories. In mental health, black-and-white thinking is known as a ""cognitive distortion,"" (link is external) not a great habit in a leader. Extreme narcissists love to divide the world (link is external) this way because they never have to feel vulnerable. They can flee, or label anyone who makes them feel unsure of their special status as ""enemies,"" while cozying up to everyone else who bows to their will as ""friends."" Be very careful that you don't punish leaders for seeing the gray around them. People who think this way eventually draw up a list of enemies; and one day, you may find yourself on it.

4.37674E+14,We the People,437674196342052_774956565947145,Timeline Photos,"The term ""racists"" was first coined in print by Leon Trotsky, a communist and mass murderer, in a 1930 piece called the History of the Russian Revolution (translated into English in 1932). He coined the term in a paragraph where he is mocking what he called ""Slavophilism"", which Trotsky claims is the ""messianism of backwardness"". In the same breath, the paragraph on the so-called racists also speaks of ""Teutonic jackasses"", thus from the very beginning the term came from the mouth of a communist in a thoroughly Europhobic context. (anti-white)

Today the word is used as a political and social tool of speech and thought oppression. It is the primary buzzword of the left and the naive who use it at EVERY given opportunity. The left use the word in their own context for their own aims, the true definition of 'racism' is acknowledging the fact that racial differences exist as part of true human bio-diversity, and that each race has characteristics and abilities unique to them as nature intended. The left, who want an end to white Western civilization and who use Cultural Marxism to achieve it, brainwash the worlds white population into believing that race is trivial and that we are all the same. Their aim is for whites to be unaware of racial realities and to be apathetic towards their own dispossession.

Anybody who is racially aware, is labeled a 'racist' which by the lefts portrayal of the term means that we are naziswhowantkillsixmillionjews and who want to colonize the world oppressing all non-whites. 

All races are racist, but the left will say that 'racism' as they define it, does not apply to non-whites and especially blacks, because of the 'oppression' the 'white race has caused to the black race' so therefore in their warped opinion, only whites can be racist. And anything blacks do, no matter how abhorrent, is justifiable because of their real or perceived oppression by 'whitey'. This is implanted into their minds via the cultural Marxist brainwashing institutions known as the universities, which are on the ideological front line churning out little programmed robots who continue the false anti-white narrative. Whites need their own intelligentsia to combat these anti-white lies and indoctrination. 

The term 'racist' is the primary silencing tactic of the left. Any expression of racial awareness, opposition to mass immigration or anti-miscegenation, leads to the left applying the term to your views. This is intended to make your views seem wrong going by THEIR definition of the term which has become dominant in the discourse on race and mass immigration. 

Whites now hardly identify as a racial group with interests specific to them, this is because of decades of brainwashing and the use of the term racist by the left. They fail to understand one critical thing, they are being dispossessed of their ancestral homelands because of a word intended to do exactly that. They are so worried about being labeled a racist that they prefer to say nothing, or no longer see race as a biological reality and actually believe that to become a minority is not a problem because 'we are all the same'. This is exactly what the left had hoped for, they knew that a racially aware white global population, would never have allowed or accepted what is being done to them, so infiltrated all of the major institutions of influence over public opinion and thought. Gradually over the decades they have infiltrated the minds of their target population and turned them against themselves. 

There is some good news, it isn't all doom and gloom, there is an awakening of sorts. Whites the world over are starting to understand what is happening and why. Nowhere enough to make a difference as yet, but in the coming years i do believe the tables will be turned. And one way that this will be achieved I believe, is the increasing number of pro-white academics who talk about these issues. They are very well educated and people who the left will have a hard time combating. If these pro-white academics get it together and create a global pro- white intelligentsia exposing the left and cultural Marxist ideas, then whites will start to sit up and take notice. What they need is a major backer, somebody who has the resources to push them on to the next level. What is needed is a foothold in the media, and representation in the universities to begin the process of reversing the damage done. The left have succeeded thus far because they have completely dominated these areas without opposition. When that domination is broken, then I believe the awakening will happen quickly.",,14/10/2015 00:00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1.42026E+14,One Nation Under God,142026122544366_1197629020317399,One Nation Under God,ï¿½ï¿½ Can I have an Amen!,"Pastor Ken Hutcherson to Rev. Al Sharpton: ?˜Not Again??

I was born in Anniston, Alabama, in the 50s and had to fight for my equality most of my life. You see, there were many who thought I should be treated like a second class citizen, drink from a different water fountain, sit in the back of the bus, be counted as three-quarters of a person, go to a different school, eat and sit in the black section of restaurants, use a different bathroom; you know, be separate but equal. Then came Dr. Martin Luther King and all that started to change and praise God! I became a Christian in 1969. Today, I find myself again being put in that same category as a second class citizen, and I am not going to have that same fight.

I did not become a Christian to live the 50s and 60s all over a second time. Muslims have more rights and freedom of religion than I do as a Christian. Tell a Muslim he can?™t pray at school or at the airport or downtown when prayer time is called for, and see what happens. Tell a Muslim cleric serving as a chaplain in our brilliant military that he has to marry a same-sex couple, and see what happens. Some of you are saying ?œwhat is that about???Well hold on to your hat, there is more to come.

But as a Christian, let me say Merry Christmas on a national holiday called Christmas and you?™d think Satan incarnate himself just showed up. I?™m sorry that is a bad example because if Satan did show up, he would get more respect than Christians, Jews, Tea Partiers, patriots and conservatives. Thus all the forenamed groups, and any like them, must stand and fight for their equal rights that are disappearing faster than San Antonio fans after game seven of the NBA championship in Miami. This brings me to the point of Al Sharpton?™s recent comments about our movement of taking back our civil rights as conservatives.

You mocked Glenn Beck, thus all of us, with your insult on the tea party fighting for their equal rights. Do you think we are going to go find a hole and hide somewhere? Mr. Sharpton that is not going to happen anymore. We refuse to sit by and let you or anyone else mock, attack, demean or laugh at our beliefs, and think it is okay to push us to the back of the Capitol in DC assuming we will just shut up.

Let me see if I can explain something to you, Al, that it seems you have forgotten. When you and Dr. King fought for our civil rights, was it because no one else had their equal rights? Black people were the first to get their equal rights, right? I presume you think that is correct the way you are talking. We both know that the reason why Dr. King and thousands of others fought during the Civil rights movement was because someone else had their rights and liberties, and blacks didn?™t. My question to you Mr. Sharpton is who had those rights when we as a black people didn?™t? It is true then that equal rights existed first for us to want them. Seems to me it was the white race that enjoyed that freedom. We saw it, said we wanted some of that, and fought and died until we got it. So why is it that you think Judeo-Christian believers, the religious right, tea partiers, patriots and white people in general who are starting to feel like second class citizens and separate but equal; are being scrutinized by the IRS and spied on by the NSA. Why should they not stand up and demand equal treatment under the law and the Constitution of these United States of America? The greatest nation ever founded under the banner of freedom, one nation under God, gives its citizens certain inalienable rights and the promise that they have the right to pursue their happiness. I believe we are endowed with those rights Mr. Sharpton, and deep down you know we are too.

As a black man Al, who went through the Civil rights fight in the 60s just like you did, and saw the first freedom bus burn in my home town of Anniston, Alabama, on May 14, 1961; I hated Dr. King for his non-violent philosophy. That did not change until I became a Christian later in life. Then I understood God?™s biblical truth of love your enemy and do good to those who hate and persecute you. I think I have the right to tell you this sir; I think the likes of you and Jesse Jackson have done more damage to the black race than any white man will ever accomplish. You see as long as you can produce an ethnicity with a victim mentality to keep them in poverty, as the two of you get richer ??you know like poverty pimps ??and convince them that it is the white man?™s fault because he has his boot on their necks, and as long as you teach our beautiful black women that there is a government out there to be their baby?™s daddy, the two of you win. You are the self-proclaimed, appointed leaders of the black people. How we as black people have swallowed the lie that we have to have certain black leaders to get on the government teat escapes me.

Six-year-old Madison Pruitt, who has cancer, wanted to become a cop.

So on Wednesday afternoon, interim Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson walked two blocks from the Gresham District police station to Madison?™s home in the Auburn Gresham neighborhood to make her dream come true.

Marching behind Johnson were about 75 cops, including two on horseback.

?œI heard your lifelong dream was to be a Chicago Police officer,??Johnson told the little girl, who was bundled up and sitting in a wheelchair as the two met on the front porch of her home where she is receiving hospice care.

?œSo today I?™m going to make it official, and make you a lifelong Chicago Police officer, congratulations,??he said, placing a Chicago police cap on her head. The brim promptly sank down over her face.

In a voice not more than a squeak, Madison said she wanted to be a police officer ?œbecause you get to protect people.??
Each officer made their way up to the front porch to see Madison, including one of the mounted patrolman ??still on his horse. Another officer had his police canine ??a black lab ??by his side.

Madison?™s grandmother, Pamlor Nelson, smiled and cried as she looked on.

The ceremony was originally supposed to be held at the nearby police station, but when Madison?™s health prevented her from leaving home, officers called a last-minute audible and went to her.

?œI am overjoyed with the Chicago Police Department,??Nelson said. ?œIt makes me feel real joyful. That was the most wonderful part, when they said they were going to come to us.??
Madison?™s law enforcement aspirations developed recently, Nelson said, noting that there are a few cops in the family.

?œWhen she was little she said she just wanted to wash dishes and clean up the house,??she added with a laugh.

?œHer nickname is ?˜Bossy Mama,??so that says a lot. How I know she?™s doing good is when she starts to boss me around,??Nelson said. ?œShe?™s a girly girl. She loves her nails done. She likes to get her hair done. She loves riding her bike and playing with her cousins.??
Madison was diagnosed last April with rhabdomyosarcoma, a muscle cancer, and has undergone radiation and chemotherapy. The cancer went into remission but returned around the holidays, Nelson said.

?œI?™ve been through a lot of things in my career, but this right here, it knocks me back,??said Sgt. Ernest Spradley, who heads up the district?™s Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy.

Asked about the significance of Johnson and other top command staff attending the event, Spradley said: ?œIt means that there is a brighter day for the police department, we have a superintendent that the entire department loves. And he loves us. He?™s going to make us proud, and we?™re going to make him proud. And this is just indicative of what we can all do as a city united together.??http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/girls-dream-of-becoming-a-cop-comes-true/",Interim Chicago Police Supt.

1.81135E+11,Law Enforcement Today,181135410243_10157542279835244,Justice Department to Track Use of Force by Police Across U.S.,"ALL OF A SUDDEN OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL NOW START COLLECTING NATIONWIDE DATA ON POLICE SHOOTINGS AND OTHER VIOLENT ENCOUNTERS WITH THE PUBLIC, AFTER A SERIES OF PROTESTS AND INVESTIGATIONS

Why do YOU think this project is being started? 

WASHINGTON ??The Justice Department said Thursday that it would start collecting nationwide data early next year on police shootings and other violent encounters with the public, after a series of protests and investigations since 2014 spurred by a string of deadly episodes.

The project, the most ambitious the federal government has undertaken in tracking the use of force by police officers, is meant to fill what officials say is a huge and frustrating void in publicly available data on the shootings that have roiled the country.

Under the plan, the Justice Department will gather more data on the use of force by federal agents and help local departments report information on a wider range of police encounters.

But a number of the reporting steps will rely on local police officials to voluntarily submit data, and some civil rights advocates said the Justice Department had not made clear how it would impose financial penalties set by Congress to encourage the reporting of police shootings.

?œI can?™t believe two years into this crisis that we?™re still having conversations about data,??said Kanya Bennett, a lawyer in Washington for the American Civil Liberties Union, which met with the Justice Department to discuss the plan.

With President Obama leaving office in three months, Ms. Bennett said, ?œthis is essentially being punted to the next administration.??
After a series of fatal encounters in places like Ferguson, Mo.; Charlotte, N.C.; Tulsa, Okla.; Baton Rouge, La.; Cleveland; Milwaukee; Baltimore; and Staten Island ??many involving unarmed black men and caught on video ??officials have struggled to gather basic information about how often such episodes occur and what can be done.

The Raw Videos That Have Sparked Outrage Over Police Treatment of Blacks
A collection of videos that have led to nationwide protests, federal investigations and changes in policy and attitudes on race.

The most comprehensive records on police shootings have come from the news media, particularly The Washington Post and The Guardian, which have created running databases.

James B. Comey, the director of the F.B.I., told lawmakers last year that it was ?œembarrassing??that the news media could produce better data than his own agency on such an important issue.

?œWe can?™t have an informed discussion because we don?™t have data,??Mr. Comey told the House Judiciary Committee last October.

?œPeople have data about who went to a movie last weekend, or how many books were sold, or how many cases of the flu walked into the emergency room,??he said, ?œand I cannot tell you how many people were shot by police in the United States last month, last year, or anything about the demographic. And that?™s a very bad place to be.??
According to the Post database, 991 people were fatally shot by the police last year, and 754 have been so far this year.

Under the Justice Department plan, the F.B.I. is to begin a pilot program early next year to assemble data on the use of force by about 178,000 agents at major federal law enforcement agencies including the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Marshals Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the F.B.I. itself.

In addition, the Justice Department plans to begin collecting data from local and state law enforcement departments on ?œin custody??deaths ??not just in shootings, but in cases of suicide and natural death as well.

A measure passed by Congress in 2014 called the Death in Custody Reporting Act required local departments to report only fatal encounters. Justice Department officials said they would rely on local police officials to voluntarily report nonlethal encounters as well.

Under a third part of the plan, the Justice Department said it was authorizing $750,000 for a ?œpolice data initiative??designed to help local departments collect and publicly release information on a wider range of actions, including stops of citizens, searches, the use of force, shootings and other encounters.

Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said in announcing the plan Thursday that comprehensive and accurate data on police encounters was essential in ?œincreasing transparency and building trust between law enforcement and the communities we serve.??
Lacking better data has made it ?œvery, very hard??to determine the causes of police shootings, or even whether there was an actual increase in such episodes or simply more publicity about them, Ms. Lynch said at an event Thursday night at Georgetown University.

The law passed by Congress in 2014 for reporting in-custody deaths allows the attorney general to impose financial penalties on states that do not report data.

But Ms. Bennett, the A.C.L.U. lawyer, faulted the Justice Department for failing to explain how that would happen under the new plan.

In a letter to the Justice Department last week, the A.C.L.U. and 95 other groups pushing for greater accountability in police shootings wrote that imposing financial penalties was critical to the success of the program. In the past, the letter said, ?œvoluntary reporting programs on police-community encounters have failed.??
The steps announced by the Justice Department grew out of a presidential commission appointed by Mr. Obama in 2014 to study ways of reducing conflict and tensions between police departments and the communities they serve.

Announcing a series of recommendations from the commission in March 2015, Mr. Obama said that the country needed to seize the opportunity to ?œtransform??police-community relations.

?œWe have a great opportunity, coming out of some great conflict and tragedy, so that everybody feels safer and our law enforcement officers feel, rather than being embattled, feel fully supported,??he said.

The Charlotte Fire Department is calling the incident arson.

A resident at an apartment building near the Briar Creek Road Baptist Church called 911 at around 1 a.m. on Wednesday to report that the church was on fire. The fire department said it took approximately an hour to put out the blaze, which ended in two firefighters being treated for heat-related trauma. The department says they are both expected to recover.

A beautiful 22-year-old mother of a 3-year-old-daughter died in police custody on Tuesday, May 10, and nobody's talking. Not the police. Not the jail. Not the medical examiner. Not the local press.

Nobody.

If you Google her name, it's as if she never existed.

Symone Nicole Marshall, according to her family, was in a brutal car accident on April 26 in which her car flipped over several times before landing in a ditch.

Instead of being taken to the hospital, though, she was taken to the Walker County Jail in Huntsville, Tex., about an hour north of Houston.

Speaking to her sister, Honey, Symone said from jail that someone ran her off the road.

""My sister Symone moved to Texas for a fresh start in life a few months ago. She was doing good down there, had a job and was about to buy a house. She's a beautiful person, never been in trouble before and didn't deserve this,"" said Honey Marshall.

""When I talked to her from jail, she complained that her head was hurting and she kept blacking out,"" said her sister.

""I called the jail several times and requested for them to take her to a real hospital and they wouldn't do so. If they would have this, her death could have been prevented and my sister would still be here. My heart hurts so bad. She was my best friend. I am so angry that they did this to her.""

Police and jail officials declined to comment or release information about the accident to the Daily News. Marshall's family also said they have not been able to get information from officials.

With all of the focus on police brutality on America's streets, another place full of injustice exists beyond the reach of cellphone cameras or accessible eyewitnesses ??America's jails and prisons. They are chewing people up and spitting them out.

While 1,207 people were killed by American police in 2015, most estimates are that a number two or three times that size represent in-custody deaths. Nobody has a definitive answer.

And that's the problem ??answers and facts are hard to come by when someone dies in police custody.

Barring police coming out and saying, ""You know what? We're going to shoot straight with you here. We killed your loved one. We're killers. It's what we do,"" it's almost impossible to understand exactly what happened here.

This much I do know:

Young black girls and women like Gynnya McMillen, Sandra Bland,  Natasha McKenna, and now Symone Marshall are going to local jails alive and leaving on stretchers and in body bags ??never to be seen again.

1.81135E+11,Law Enforcement Today,181135410243_10157512094935244,Timeline Photos,"Chicago Police Department Drafts New Use-of-Force Policy

Chicago's police chief on Friday released details of a proposed new policy that would require officers to use the least amount of force necessary and emphasizes the ""sanctity of life.""

The proposal requires officers to intervene if they see another officer violating department policy. Deadly force could only be used to prevent immediate threat of death or great bodily harm. The announcement comes as the U.S. Department of Justice investigates the department after a white officer was charged with murder for the fatal shooting of a black teenager in 2014. Laquan McDonald was shot 16 times.

Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told reporters at a news conference that the draft aims to ""clarify response options to officers during split-second decisions or in the critical time before those moments while placing a heavy emphasis on the sanctity of life.""

The policy will undergo 45 days of public comment , something the superintendent called a department first and a step toward previously promised transparency efforts. He said the department would use less-lethal methods as often as possible.

""When I say to you that this is a new day at CPD, it's not a joke and I'm not kidding about it,"" Johnson said.

After the public feedback period ends Nov. 21, the department will review contributions with the goal of having a final version of the policy by the end of the year. Officers will then be trained according to the policy.

Anne Kirkpatrick, the department's chief of organizational development, said the policy includes the need for independent justification every time a tool, like a stun gun or baton, is used in force.

""This is a new way for us to do business,"" she said.

The policy also would require police to offer medical aid to those injured in use-of-force incidents. It asks them to de-escalate situations and not use force unless ""all other reasonable alternatives have been exhausted.""

Last month, the department started mandatory de-escalation training to help officers better assess how to respond to complex and tense situations. The department also has expanded its use of body cameras.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel, in his second term, has been trying to rebuild trust in his leadership, particularly after the McDonald shooting. Officer Jason Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder, but only after a judge ordered the public release of the squad car video last year. The graphic video of the shooting prompted citywide protests and police leadership changes.

Emanuel's administration also has announced plans to add nearly 1,000 police officers. Earlier this week, the Chicago City Council voted to form a new agency to investigate the police force called the Civilian Office of Police Accountability and create a new deputy inspector whose job will be to monitor the department.

Chicago has seen a dramatic rise in the number of shootings and homicides this year, including 91 homicide victims in August, the deadliest month in the city in two decades. Overall, the city has recorded more than 500 homicides this year ??higher than all of 2015 ??and is on pace to climb past the 600-homicide mark for the first time since 2003.

The city's image has also come up on the presidential campaign trail with Republican nominee Donald Trump suggesting that Chicago is more violent than Afghanistan. Trump also endorsed a stop-and-frisk policing method for the city, which a federal judge said New York City used unconstitutionally because of its overwhelming impact on minority residents.

Seven black men called a 28-year-old man ?œwhite bread??and other insults as they threatened him on Vanderbilt Ave. and Targee St. in Fox Hills about 3 p.m. on June 19, cops said.
The group then chased after the white victim, punching and kicking him.
They struck him with a milk crate, a fluorescent light bulb, a bottle and other garbage they picked up, officials said.
The victim managed to escape his attackers, suffering only minor wounds. The NYPD?™s hate crimes task force is investigating.

White Only sign at University of Buffalo. (Campus Reform)
Students at the University of Buffalo were outraged after ?œWhite Only??signs were posted above certain bathrooms on campus.  The students said the signs were a ?œhate crime, an act of terrorism.??ABC27 reported:
Students at the University at Buffalo found signs reading ?œWhite Only??posted near restrooms and water fountains Wednesday morning.
?œIt brought up feelings of the past of a past that our generation has never seen which I think is why it was so shocking for us to see,??said Micah Oliver, the President for the Black Student Union.
He said emotions were running high as the club had more than 100 students turn out to their regular meeting Wednesday night to discuss the signs.
?œThere was fear expressed, anger, disappointment ??all of that,??said Oliver.
A University at Buffalo spokesperson released this statement to News 4 ???œAfter an initial investigation by University Police, it has been determined that the signs posted in Clemens Hall were part of a student art project. The University is continuing to review this matter through appropriate university policies and procedures.??But it wasn?™t a hate crime.
The signs were put up by an unhinged black graduate student.
This week black graduate student Ashley Powell admitted to hanging the racist signs.
Buffalo News reported:
Campus police at the University at Buffalo removed signs saying ?œWhite Only??and ?œBlack Only??Wednesday afternoon from Clemens Hall on the North Campus in Amherst. A university spokesperson said a police investigation found that the signs ?œwere part of a student art project.??The campus newspaper, The Spectrum, reported on its website that Ashley Powell, a graduate fine arts student who is black, told a meeting of the Black Student Union Wednesday evening that she posted the signs. The Spectrum noted that many students at the meeting were outraged and walked out.

4.37674E+14,We the People,437674196342052_776751232434345,Timeline Photos,"Did you know over 28 Million Africans have been enslaved in the Muslim world during the past 14 centuries?  

While much has been written concerning the Transatlantic slave trade, surprisingly little attention has been given to the Islamic slave trade across the Sahara, the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. While the European involvement in the Transatlantic slave trade to the Americas lasted for just over three centuries, the Arab involvement in the slave trade has lasted fourteen centuries, and in some parts of the Muslim world is still continuing to this day. 

A comparison of the Muslim slave trade to the American slave trade reveals some interesting contrasts. While two out of every three slaves shipped across the Atlantic were men, the proportions were reversed in the Muslim slave trade. Two women for every man were enslaved by the Muslims. 

While the mortality rate for slaves being transported across the Atlantic was as high as 10%, the percentage of slaves dying in transit in the Transsahara and East African slave trade was between 80 and 90%! 

While almost all the slaves shipped across the Atlantic were for agricultural work, most of the slaves destined for the Muslim Middle East were for sexual exploitation as concubines, in harems, and for military service. 

While many children were born to slaves in the Americas, and millions of their descendants are citizens in Brazil and the USA to this day, very few descendants of the slaves that ended up in the Middle East survive. 

While most slaves who went to the Americas could marry and have families, most of the male slaves destined for the Middle East were castrated, and most of the children born to the women were killed at birth. 

Slavery has been justified by Mohammed?™s example, as laid out in the Koran and in the records of the Islamic prophet?™s words and deeds called the ?œhadiths.??In addition, Mohammed?™s father was named by what has become a common Muslim appellation, Abd-Allah or Abdullah, which means ?œSlave of Allah,??a moniker proudly worn by millions of Muslims. Islam itself means ?œsubmission,??as in being a slave to Allah?™s will.

?œA believing slave is better than an idolater?¦â€?
Muhammad, Quran 2:221

?œâ€¦you may marry other women who seem good to you: two, three, or four of them. But if you fear that you cannot maintain equality among them marry one only or any slave-girls you may own.??
Muhammad, Quran 4:3

?œBlessed are the believers?¦who restrain their carnal desires (except with their wives and slave-girls, for these are lawful to them???¦â€?
Muhammad, Quran 23:1

?œProphet, We have made lawful for you the wives to whom you have granted dowries and the slave-girls whom God has given you as booty?¦â€?
Quran 33:50

?œMohammed had many male and female slaves. He used to buy and sell them, but he purchased more slaves than he sold, especially after God empowered him by His message, as well as after his immigration from Mecca. He once sold one black slave for two?? His purchases of slaves were more than he sold????
Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, Zad al-Ma?™ad (1.160)

?œSo Muhammad began seizing their herds and their property bit by bit. He conquered home by home. The Messenger took some people captive, including Safiyah and her two cousins. The Prophet chose Safiyah for himself.??
Tabari VIII 116; Ishaq 511

?œWe conquered Khaibar, took the captives, and the booty was collected. Dihya came and said, ?˜O Allah?™s Prophet! Give me a slave girl from the captives.??The Prophet said, ?˜Go and take any slave girl.'??
Sahih Bukhari 1:8:367

?œâ€¦Khaibar is destroyed??Then the inhabitants of Khaibar came out running on the roads. The Prophet had their warriors killed, their offspring and woman taken as captives.??
Sahih Bukhari 5:59:512

?œThe Prophet Muhammad was heard saying: ?˜The smallest reward for the people of paradise is an abode where there are 80,000 servants and 72 wives????
Commentary by Ibn Kathir on Koranic chapter Al-Rahman (55), verse 72

?œA man from the Ansar called Basrah said: I married a virgin woman in her veil. When I entered upon her, I found her pregnant. (I mentioned this to the Prophet). The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: She will get the dower [""morning gift""], for you made her vagina lawful for you. The child will be your slave. When she has begotten (a child), flog her?¦â€?
Sunan Abu-Dawud 11:2070

?œMuhammad took pains in urging the faithful to free their slaves as a way of expiating their sins. Some Muslim scholars have taken this to mean that his true motive was to bring about a gradual elimination of slavery. Far more persuasive is the argument that by lending the moral authority of Islam to slavery, Muhammad assured its legitimacy. Thus, in lightening the fetter, he riveted it ever more firmly in place.??
Murray Gordon, Slavery in the Arab World (19)

There are many more such quotes from Islamic texts and authorities that validate the practice of slavery. Conservative estimates place the number of Africans enslaved by Arab Muslims over the past 1,400 years at between 11 and 18 million, while others say that, when those killed in the raids or who died in transit to the Arab slave markets ??some 80% ??are factored in, the toll is at least 112 million. Hundreds of thousands of white Europeans also ended up in Islamic slave markets, the women being a particular favorite of Arab slavers.

Islam?™s disturbing legacy of slavery

We are often told that Islam is ?œpeaceful,??but few know about the long practice of slavery within Islam, which continues to this day.

?œSlavery is a part of Islam??Slavery is part of jihad, and jihad will remain as long there is Islam??[Those who argue that slavery has been abolished are] ignorant, not scholars. They are merely writers. Whoever says such things is an infidel.??
Sheikh Saleh Al-Fawzan, member of Senior Council of Clerics, Saudi Arabia?™s highest religious body (2003)

?œSlavery still exists in a host of majority-Muslim countries (especially Sudan and Mauritania, also Saudi Arabia and Pakistan)????
Dr. Daniel Pipes, New York Post (July 30, 2002)

?œBesides being practiced more or less openly today in Sudan and Mauritania, there is evidence that slavery still continues beneath the surface in some majority-Muslim countries as well ??notably Saudi Arabia, which only abolished slavery in 1962, Yemen and Oman, both of which ended legal slavery in 1970, and Niger, which didn?™t abolish slavery until 2004. In Niger, the ban is widely ignored, and as many as one million people remain in bondage. Slaves are bred, often raped, and generally treated like animals.??
Robert Spencer, ?œThe Persistence of Islamic Slavery??
?œâ€¦the worst, most inhumane and most diabolical institution of the black African slave trade was initiated, refined, perpetrated and implemented by the Mohammedan Arabs and later aided and abetted by the black converts to Mohammedan Islam.??
John Alembillah Azumah, Legacy of Arab-Islam in Africa

?œHistorically, the major juristic schools of Islam traditionally accepted the institution of slavery. The Islamic prophet Muhammad and many of his companions bought, sold, freed and captured slaves. ?¦The Qur?™an includes multiple references to slaves, slave women, slave concubinage, and the freeing of slaves. It accepts the institution of slavery?? Slaves are mentioned in at least twenty-nine verses of the Qur?™an??Slavery was also perceived as a means of converting non-Muslims to Islam??According to some jurists ??especially among the Shi?™a ??only Muslim slaves should be liberated??Evidence from slaves is rarely viable in a court of law [since] slaves are regarded as inferior in Islamic law??Slaves are not permitted to possess or inherit property, or conduct independent business, and may conduct financial dealings only as a representative of the master?? Slave women were required mainly as concubines and menials. A Muslim slaveholder was entitled by law to the sexual enjoyment of his slave women?? There is no limit on the number of concubines a master may possess?? There was a high death toll among all classes of slaves. Slaves usually came from remote places and, lacking immunities, died in large numbers?? the Islamic market demand for children was much greater than the American one?? According to multiple sources, religious calls have also been made to capture and enslave Jewish women?? Organized criminal gangs smuggle children into Saudi Arabia where they are enslaved, sometimes mutilated, and forced to work as beggars.??
?œIslam and slavery??
?œRaiding non-Muslim territories became a constant phenomenon after Muslim powers were established in Southeast Asia?? Over five centuries after Muslims came to power in the early fifteenth century, those animist hill peoples completely disappeared as a result of their incorporation, through enslavement, into the Muslim populace of Malaya, Sumatra and Borneo ?˜by a mixture of raiding, tribute and purchase, especially of children.?™â€?In Muslim wars in Southeast Asia, the enslavement was often complete: the entire population were enslaved and carried away?? These enslaved people?¦[belonged] to the polytheistic Hindu, Buddhist and Animist creeds????

3.25936E+14,Joe Walsh,325935647511804_881729308599099,,"My tweet heard round the world.

Thursday night, halfway thru the Dallas killer's rampage, I tweeted the following: 

""3 Dallas Cops shot, 7 wounded. This is war. Obama & black lives matter punks watch out. Real America is coming.""

Within minutes, all hell broke loose. People from all over the country accused me of threatening Obama's life. Thousands, including singer John Legend and idiot lefty Keith Olbermann demanded I be arrested. Many on the Left reported me to the FBI & the secret service. Twitter closed my account down and would only agree to reopen my account if that tweet was removed. For the past few days, I've received death threats from people all over the world. The Left ""doxxed"" me. Doxxing is where you take someone's personal information and make it public. So they got ahold of my phone #'s & emails and folks on the Left have been calling & emailing threats since Thursday night. They got ahold of the phone #'s & emails for each of the radio stations I'm on and organized those on the Left from all over the country to call & email the radio stations to get me fired and tossed off the air. The Left is working to get advertisers to boycott my radio stations. 

Ok, let's briefly be clear about one thing. Did I threaten Obama physically and make a call to incite violence against Obama or anyone else? Heck no. I would never, ever do such a thing. As a former Congressman and syndicated radio host, that would be a pretty stupid thing to so. Talk about a career killer. It would also be very wrong & reprehensible. No sane person I know would ever incite violence against the President of the United States. This accusation is just silly, the Left knows it, but they don't care. They want to shut me up.

Here's what I meant by the tweet and I stand by what I meant. 

There is a war against our Police in this Country. Bad elements have declared war on our Cops and it's time for the rest of us who are on the side of Cops to engage and begin defending Cops. I believe that Obama's words and black lives matter's deeds have gotten Cops killed. After every Police shooting since Ferguson, Obama has come out and blamed the Police and said Cops are racist. Obama did it again this week when he accused the MN Cop of racism before any investigation or due process. #BLM has attacked Cops and demanded the killing of Cops. All this Cop hating has led to thugs on the street attacking Cops. That's what happened in Dallas. 

Remember, since Ferguson, unprovoked attacks on Cops are up, ambush attacks on Cops are up, altercations with Cops are up & assassination attempts on Cops are up.

In my tweet I said ""watch out Obama, real America is coming."" I've been accused of racism by saying ""real America."" By ""real Americans"" I mean Americans - white, black & brown - who support our Police. It's got nothing to do with race. If you attack the Police in this country, no matter your race, in my book you're not a real American.

I did tell Obama to ""watch out."" Of course it wasn't a physical threat. But it was a warning to him. Real Americans are now going to fight back against his Cop hating. We're going to march, protest, boycott and speak up for our Police. We're going to defend our Police. Watch out Obama, we're waking up. 

That's what I meant by my tweet. And I stand by every word of it.

When a Cop shoots a young black man, Obama always cries racism. When the black Dallas shooter said he wanted to kill white Cops, Obama said he was ""demented."" Obama is dividing us.

Unless we all - white, black & brown - stand up for our Police, this horrible Cop killing will continue. It's time. Way past time to fight against it.

The Left is organized. They fight. They're threatening my life, trying to get me fired, and trying to shut me up. 

We who stand with our Police need to get organized and learn to fight as well.

Art Littlejohn, spokesman for the Spartanburg Police Department said the responding officers were called about a domestic violence dispute where a weapon may be involved.

SPARTANBURG, S.C. ?”A man whose arrest was caught on cellphone video in Spartanburg is talking to News 4.

WARNING: EXTREMELY GRAPHIC LANGUAGE USED

Mobile users: Click here to see video 

The incident took place at a home on Nevada Street Sunday afternoon just after 1:30 p.m.

Maj. Art Littlejohn, spokesman for the Spartanburg Police Department said the responding officers were called about a domestic violence dispute where a weapon may be involved.

According to the incident report, a witness told police that Jarvis Terrell, 29, had been fighting with the mother of his children.

The homeowner told police that Terrell was asked to leave several times, but he refused, according to the report.

Officers indicated in the report that Terrell was being loud, but not belligerent when they arrived.

An officer stated in the report that they ?œnoticed an abnormally large bulge and something shiny and sliver in his [Terrell?™s] right back pocket, but could not make out what the object was.??
According to the report, the officer told Terrell he was not under arrest but needed to pat him down. The officer stated that Terrell ?œbegan yelling that we could not do that and he knew his rights.??
Littlejohn said it?™s legal in the state of South Carolina to pat someone down if they have reason to believe someone has a weapon. Littlejohn said, in this case, the officers wanted to do a pat down frisk, because of concern of a weapon.

Terrell is not in town tonight, but talked to News 4's Liz Lohuis on the phone.

""They should have let me just let me explain to them what happened, but instead they want to violate my rights,"" said Terrell.

The officer reported that Terrell struggled with them and they tried to trip him. According to the report, it took more than 20 seconds for the two officers to get control of Terrell?™s arms.

The cellphone video started recording near the time the two officers tried to trip Terrell in effort to get him to the ground. The officers struggled with Terrell for several seconds and one officer can be seen kneeing Terrell in the chest.

The person recording stepped closer when Terrell fell to his back and blood could be seen coming from his face and nose area.

It takes the officers more than 10 seconds to flip Terrell over into a face-down position.

For the next 30 seconds an officer can be seen pressing his knee to the back of Terrell?™s neck as the other officer attempted to put handcuffs around both of Terrell?™s wrists.

""My body is still sore to this day.  My ribs are sore.  When I breathe it hurts,"" said Terrell.

According to the incident report, the officers found a black wallet and large set of keys in Terrell?™s right back pocket.

Terrell was arrested and charged with trespass first-degree, two counts of assault and battery third-degree.

Littlejohn said that the situation could have been avoided if Terrell would?™ve let the officers pat him down.

Littlejohn said the resisting arrest falls under the assault and battery charges.

Terrell was released Sunday and neighbors say he is now back in Washington, D.C.

Video of the arrest has gotten nearly 17,000 views and more than 350 shares since it was posted to Facebook Sunday.

A man has been arrested after a police memorial in Sydney's CBD commemorating officers who have died in the line of duty was vandalised for the second time in less than a week.
Members of the public phoned triple zero about 6.40pm on Tuesday to report a man behaving suspiciously near the pedestrian overpass at The Domain, not far from the NSW Police Force Wall of Remembrance.

Police believe the same person is responsible for the two vandal attacks in a week.

Nearly 30 panels in that wall, which bears the names of officers killed on the job, had to be replaced after a vandal used a piece of rock or glass to scratch and write abusive messages on the wall on Friday afternoon, in an attack NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said left him ""appalled and saddened"".

The wall had just been fixed, when it was defaced for a second time on Tuesday afternoon. Police said they found black graffiti splashed across the wall and on the ground in front of the memorial.

Police arrested a 30-year-old man at The Domain following the tip-off from the public. Police allege the man resisted arrest, and allegedly smashed the rear window of a police caged truck as he was being driven the short distance to Day Street police station in the city.

Later in the night, police took the man to St Vincent's Hospital where he was being assessed for ""possible medical conditions"", police said. He remained there early on Wednesday morning, and no charges had been laid.

""Police believe [Tuesday night's vandal attack] to be linked to the incident on Friday, and charges are expected when the 30-year-old man is released from hospital,"" a NSW Police spokesman said.
The new graffiti was expected to be removed on Wednesday.
Following Friday's attack, police released CCTV footage of a man carrying a skateboard and who walked ""with a distinctive swagger"" who was wanted over that incident.

Mr Scipione also made a personal plea for anyone who knew him to come forward.

""There is no more important or sacred place in the country to the NSW Police Force than this memorial,"" he said at the time.
""The person who has done this knows who they are. I am appalled and saddened that the names of our state's heroes have been desecrated.""

No, in this case most of the ex post facto media homilies are about how we have to get rid of guns.

On a random July day, while driving off of the campus of Prairie View A&M University, Sandra Bland made a mistake that would only prove fatal for a black woman in rural Texas.

Seeing a police car driving like a bat out of hell in her rearview mirror, Bland respectfully moved her car out of the way so that Trooper Brian Encinia could pass. In doing so, she failed to use a turn signal ??a simple error that any of us would make under the conditions.

Within minutes the officer was threatening to ""light her up"" with his stun gun, had slammed her on her head on the concrete and placed her under arrest. Three days later, Bland was dead ??allegedly found hanging in the Waller County Jail. Whether it was a suicide or a murder, we'll never really know. What we do know is that if Sandra Bland was a white professor instead of a young black activist, she'd likely have been given a ticket, told to go on her way, and be alive today to tell us all the story.

Late Thursday evening, a grand jury decided that no criminal charges will be filed against any officials at the jail over her death. It's not that this decision is surprising, few people are ever held accountable for the deaths African-Americans in police custody, but it is infuriating.

A lot of us made strong assumptions about racial progress, civil rights, and justice in 2015 that simply have not proven true. Like 1955 in Mississippi, taking a drive in 2015 in rural Texas could cost you your life.

Over these past few years, a series of non-indictments and not guilty verdicts for African-Americans that were killed going about their everyday life have worn millions of good people very thin.

Teenage Trayvon Martin was simply walking home from the convenience store with some snacks during the NBA All-Star Weekend when an armed gunman confronted and killed him. Nobody was held responsible.

Rekia Boyd was simply walking home with a group of friends in Chicago when a police officer shot her in the head from his squad car - claiming that he saw somebody holding a gun. It was a cell phone. Nobody was held responsible.

A witness claimed to Pasadena police that all-state football player Kendrec McDade had a gun. He only had a cell phone. Nobody was held responsible.

John Crawford taught us all that if you are black it may cost you your life if you pick up a fake gun from the shelves at Wal-Mart. Talking on the phone with his girlfriend and leaning on the fake gun like a cane, police shot and killed Crawford within seconds of making contact with him. He broke no laws and harmed no one. Nobody was held responsible.

These same stories are true for Eric Garner, Natasha McKenna, and scores of other black men, women, and children who each were killed by men who seemed to know that the system would always bend in their favor when they used lethal force.

When campaigning for President back in 2007, President Obama spoke of the ""audacity of hope"" in a way that had deep roots in the black experience. Hope in the face of slavery, hope in the face of lynching, hope in the face of Jim Crow ... hope in the face of long odds and violent enemies has always been the emerging refrain in Black America.

I haven't lost hope in the possibility of change, but for the first time in my life, I'm more frustrated that I am hopeful. I'm angrier than I am optimistic. Skepticism is now my standard response to requests to ""trust the system."" We've been there, done that. It leads us nowhere.

My question for America is this: What do you expect people to do when they peacefully use the justice system when their loved ones are wronged and it leaves them empty handed? What comes after that?

Then this happened. After they inserted the coat hanger in his rectum, other students came by and kicked it in him further. 

This, ladies and gentlemen, is what I think Donald Trump means when he says let's make American great...AGAIN. 

Several of the young men have been charged and are being tried as adults. The family, though, is suing 11 people, including the school officials which all created the environment for this to take place.

We now know Tashfeen Malik, one of the two California terrorist shooters, pledged allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi on Facebook before the attack. But it was only a matter of time. Radical ISIS rats roam outside Damascus, just miles from where God revealed himself to the Apostle Paul. The dead bodies of decapitated ISIS victims are rotting in Palmyra, the ancient city that Chronicles tells us was built by King Solomon. ISIS black flags now wave on the same streets where the Lord commanded Jonah to witness to the people of Nineveh. In the ancient Christian village of Sadad, an armed Christian militia will soon clash with ISIS jihadists that have overrun a neighboring city. Sadad is home to many Christian churches and its people even speak Christ?™s native tongue: Aramaic.  
 
While President Obama sits silently, the same soil that sustained our Biblical forefathers is now stained with the blood. Obama?™s strategy to defeat this evil is a complete disaster. Radical Islam is a threat to the civilized world and Obama is singularly obsessed with the threat of a sunburn.

Americans are sick and tired. The idealism and incompetence from this White House is beyond breathtaking. The White House abandons Christians and denies, disguises and hides the existence of Radical Islam, but I will not. There is good and there is evil.  ISIS is evil.

The property in the Richmond area is said to have been crawling with rats, black widow spiders, dog feces and 300 bottles of urine.
The remains which were removed","Police in San Francisco have discovered the mummified body of an elderly woman in a house said to be owned by a hoarder.
The property in the Richmond area is said to have been crawling with rats, black widow spiders, dog feces and 300 bottles of urine.
The remains which were removed from the house on Saturday are believed to be that of Anna Ragin who lived with her 65-year-old daughter Carolyn.


Police removed the body, believed to be that of Anna Ragin, from the property in the Richmond area of San Francisco. Authorities said the home was covered in debris, including dog feces and bottles of urine

Neighbors told The San Francisco Chronicle the mother had not been seen for years.
According to records another man, Archibald Ragin, lived at the property but died 15 years ago at the age of 101.
Carolyn, said to be a retired Pacific Bell worker, was taken to hospital after her mother?™s body was removed from the house.
Supervisor Eric Mar, a representative in charge of the area, told the Chronicle : ?˜The police captains I?™ve spoken with tell me this is the worst case of hoarding they have ever seen.??He was concerned for the health and safety of the residents, but questioned how the situation in the property could have gotten to such a point.
Mr Mar said: ?˜We certainly want seniors to stay in their communities as long as possible, but when people aren?™t getting adequate health care and attention, this is what happens.
?˜This appears to be a nightmare of what can happen when people age in place for too long,??he added. ?˜We need to identify what the triggers are for the city to step in.??He told the Daily Mail Online that he heard the body was wrapped up in a carpet and described that, from the outside, it looked like the home was abandoned.


Residents said the  woman had not been seen in years while police described it as the worst case of hoarding they had ever seen

When city workers arrived to clean up the body on Wednesday, they reportedly struggled to get in the door because the house was filled with so much debris.
The mess was said to have included mold and piles of trash that reached the ceiling.
They were forced to call in professional workers.
The Chronicle quote a firefighter saying the body was lightweight and wrapped in a blanket. It is not clear where it was discovered.

The creator directed attention to the wide world of race baiting that only benefits","Recently, a micro-documentary exposing the real racism taking place in America that liberals and the leftist media don?™t want you to know about was uploaded to YouTube and quickly went viral thanks to its powerful true message.
The creator directed attention to the wide world of race baiting that only benefits news ratings and race profiteers like Al Sharpton ??specifically highlighting the ?œhands up, don?™t shoot??movement and hand gesture that acted as the driving force behind months of race rioting.
And the worst part, as pointed out, was that the narrative was completely false. Michael Brown, who attempted to murder former police officer Darren Wilson, never once had his hands up in surrender. Rather, he charged Wilson like a bull in an attempt to gain control of Wilson?™s firearm.
?œYou have liberals and many poor blacks backing up this fantasy story with White House officials showing up to Michael Brown?™s funeral. A criminal who physically intimidated a store clerk while robbing him and then attacking the police officer in his vehicle,??the video?™s narrator explained.
The video also mentioned the media?™s quick assumptions to spark a false narrative, like the ?œwhite male, George Zimmerman??report that was immediately pushed by left-leaning media outlets, when in fact Zimmerman was Hispanic.
While the narrator admitted that police brutality does exist and shows a number of dash-cam videos that show police officers committing such acts against people of all skin colors, he explained that the real problem, the real issue that so-called ?œactivists??like Sharpton need to get behind, is the growing epidemic of black-on-black violence.

by Larry Elder, June 29, 2015

As we debate the #ConfederateFlag, let us recall the words of a former member of Congress on Fathers Day in 2008:

?œOf all the rocks upon which we build our lives, we are reminded today that family is the most important??
?œ[More] than half of all black children live in single-parent households?¦[Children] who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty?? nine times more likely to drop out?¦and 20 times more likely to end up in prison... 

?œSo many of these women are doing a heroic job, but they need support. They need another parent. Their children need another parent. That?™s what keeps their foundation strong. It?™s what keeps the foundation of our country strong.??
Who was the speaker? Senator Barack Obama on Fathers Day, June 15, 2008.

2.46977E+14,Being Libertarian,246976735508369_518129545059752,,"Want less criminals?  Have fewer laws.  America is the greatest incarceration state in mankind's history, currently holding 25% of all the encaged humans on the planet, in spite of having less than 5% of the world population as a whole.  There are more blacks incarcerated than were enslaved.  More than half of those incarcerated are non-violent.  

The current tax code alone is longer than the complete works of Shakespeare.  Some studies indicate the average American commits felonies everyday without even knowing it.  Who knows, maybe you'll just be trying to give your friend a cigarette, or a CD, and get the swift and lethal force of government in your face.

Libertarians think the laws should be as such: Don't hit humans.  Honor your word.  

I think most people know whether or not they're in violation of this code.  

Extrapolate that, and you'd have millions of less criminals, and much more revenue being loaned out to your local economy than being used to hire law enforcement, judges, prosecutors and the all inefficient overhead that comes with the costs of government.  Would you rather have a cheaper cell-phone, or have your money usurped to incarcerate people over plants they can't keep out of their own prisons?",,07/07/2016 00:00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.42474E+14,Robert Reich,142474049098533_1162534540425807,,"Among the nefarious supporters of Donald Trump are David Duke, former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. This morning Trump refused to disavow Duke?™s support, telling CNN?™s Jake Tapper, ?œI know nothing about David Duke; I know nothing about white supremacists.??

When asked whether he?™d condemn the Klan, Trump demurred. ?œI don't know what group you're talking about. You wouldn't want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about. ??I will do research on them and certainly I would disavow if I thought there was something wrong.??
Tapper: ?œI'm just talking about David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan here, but --""

Trump: ??I don't know David Duke. I don't believe I've ever met him. I'm pretty sure I didn't meet him. And I just don't know anything about him.""

That the leading presidential candidate of the Republican Party refuses to disavow the Ku Klux Klan and pretends never to have heard of its former leader, marks a new low in American politics. 

In reality, Trump knows his support is coming mainly from whites motivated by their fears of ?œothers????African-Americans, Latinos, Muslim-Americans, and all other minorities who are rapidly becoming the majority in America.

Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Now he wants to take that away too.","The Obama administration is moving forward with regulations designed to help diversify America?™s wealthier neighborhoods, drawing fire from critics who decry the proposal as executive overreach in search of an ?œunrealistic utopia.??A final Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) rule due out this month is aimed at ending decades of deep-rooted segregation around the country.
The regulations would use grant money as an incentive for communities to build affordable housing in more affluent areas while also taking steps to upgrade poorer areas with better schools, parks, libraries, grocery stores and transportation routes as part of a gentrification of those communities.
?œHUD is working with communities across the country to fulfill the promise of equal opportunity for all,??a HUD spokeswoman said. ?œThe proposed policy seeks to break down barriers to access to opportunity in communities supported by HUD funds.??It?™s a tough sell for some conservatives. Among them is Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), who argued that the administration ?œshouldn?™t be holding hostage grant monies aimed at community improvement based on its unrealistic utopian ideas of what every community should resemble.???œAmerican citizens and communities should be free to choose where they would like to live and not be subject to federal neighborhood engineering at the behest of an overreaching federal government,??said Gosar, who is leading an effort in the House to block the regulations.
Civil rights advocates, meanwhile, are praising the plan, arguing that it is needed to break through decades-old barriers that keep poor and minority families trapped in hardscrabble neighborhoods.
?œWe have a history of putting affordable housing in poor communities,??said Debby Goldberg, vice president at the National Fair Housing Alliance.
The Fair Housing Act of 1968 prohibited direct and intentional housing discrimination, such as a real estate agent not showing a home in a wealthy neighborhood to a black family or a bank not providing a loan based on someone?™s race.
But HUD is looking to root out more subtle forms of discrimination that take shape in local government policies that unintentionally harm minority communities, known as ?œdisparate impact.???œThis rule is not about forcing anyone to live anywhere they don?™t want to,??said Margery Turner, senior vice president at the left-leaning Urban Institute. ?œIt?™s really about addressing long-standing practices that prevent people from living where they want to.???œIn our country, decades of public policies and institutional practices have built deeply segregated and unequal neighborhoods,??Turner said.
Children growing up in poor communities have less of a chance of succeeding in life, because they face greater exposure to violence and crime, and less access to quality education and health facilities, Turner suggested.
?œSegregation is clearly a problem that is blocking upward mobility for children growing up today,??she said.
To qualify for certain funds under the regulations, cities would be required to examine patterns of segregation in neighborhoods and develop plans to address it. Those that don?™t could see the funds they use to improve blighted neighborhoods disappear, critics of the rule say.
The regulations would apply to roughly 1,250 local governments.
Hans von Spakovsky, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation, called the Obama administration ?œtoo race conscious.???œIt?™s a sign that this administration seems to take race into account on everything,??Spakovsky said.

I mean I've seen things that she has a body double or that she's had something implanted in her back. Yet, with Trump there are cold hard facts that they refuse to believe. Why? 

Is it because she's a woman? People hate that we had a black President and they can't stand there might be a woman President. Obama was not the evil people make him out to be. I've never seen a President so disrespected before from the get-go. Bush was arguably one of the worst Presidents in recent years but yet everyone seems to skip over that and blame Obama. 

Hillary is far from perfect so you don't need to let me know all her faults. Some of which are highly exaggerated. Some of which people don't even know all the facts behind. 

Trump is a very, very dangerous man. All you have to do is look at the anger and rage at his rallies. If he wins there will be more of that.

The wasp thing is making me think twice about air travel.,"We know that we?™re surrounded by the good, the bad and the completely wonky.
But just when you thought you?™d read it all, we found these 18 facts that sound completely fabricated and crazy, but are true as can be.
So hold on and don?™t call B.S. just yet.
These unbelievable facts will blow your mind, all over again.
1. So far, wasps have brought down 2 commercial airline flights, killing over 200 people.


Mud Dauber is a name commonly applied to a number of wasps, from either the family Sphecidae or Crabronidae, that build their nests from mud.

On September 12, 1980, the ill-fated Florida Commuter Airlines Flight 65 crashed, en route to the Bahamas, killing all 34 passengers and crew. The cause was determined as a malfunctioning air speed indicator, ruined by mud dauber nests that were not cleared properly from the aircraft?™s pilot tubes.
Then, on February 6, 1996, Birgenair Flight 301 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, after a black and yellow mud dauber got into the pilot tube and built its cylindrical nest inside. All 13 crew members and 176 passengers died.


2. A Chinese monk?™s devotion has left a deep mark on a temple in the monastery town of Tongren in Qinghai province. The ageing monk has been kneeling in prayer a 1,000 times each day, for the last 20 years, and his footprints are now etched upon the temple?™s wooden floor.
3. There is a tree named Pando that is technically an entire forest.
It is the clonal colony of 4700 aspen, that all share the same root system. Pando means ?˜I Spread??the tree/forest is also called The Trembling Giant.
4. Scientists in Mexico were able to turn the country?™s spirit of choice, tequila, into diamonds.
This surprise discovery was made when researchers at the National Autonomous University experimented with making ultra-thin films of diamond from organic solutions like acetone and ethanol. The mix that worked best was 40% alcohol and 60% water, very similar to the proportions used in tequila.
This just makes tequila even cooler, don?™t you think?
5. A trained Beagle assistance dog won an award when she called 911 after her owner, who is diabetic, had a seizure and collapsed.
Belle, a 17-pound beagle, became the first canine recipient of the VITA Wireless Samaritan Award. She was able to bite into her owner?™s phone and call 911 when he collapsed.
Thanks to their keen sense of smell, animals like Belle are able to detect abnormalities in a person?™s blood sugar levels. By dialing the emergency number, Belle most definitely saved her owner?™s life.
6. Thanks to technology, you now know how the sun sees you!
Here?™s an amazing video of what people look like with an ultraviolet camera.


7. In 1850, a man named Thomas Austin released 24 rabbits into the wild for sport hunting in Australia. Less than 70 years later, the rabbit population grew to a staggering 10 billion.


The rabbits were reproducing at a rate of 18 to 30 per single female rabbit per year. The reason for this could also be that Australia is the ideal place for rabbits. With mild winters, no threat of predators, natural low vegetation and an abundance of land, Australia proved to be the perfect home for the then new and invasive species.

8. A clever 18-year-old freshman crowdfunded his education by asking 2.8 million people for one penny.
In 1987, chemistry freshman Mike Hayes wrote to Chicago Tribune columnist Bob Greene, asking him to request that each of his readers send Hayes a penny.
Soon, the ?˜Many Pennies for Mike??campaign had the equivalent of 2.3 million pennies to its name. Mike was able to finance his college education, thanks to this quirky scheme, and graduated from the University of Illinois.
9. Penguins can drink salt water!
The supraorbital gland in penguins allows them to drink salt water. The gland performs the function of a filter, which lets them separate the salt from the water.
10. Looking to amp up your walking routine? Not swinging your arms when you walk increases the effort of walking by 12%, the equivalent of walking 20% faster or carrying a 10 kg backpack. Feel those calories melt away!
11. Bill Haast, the ?˜Snake Man?? was bitten by snakes at least 173 times over the course of his 100-year-old life. The secret to his survival was that he injected himself with snake venom every single day for 60 years and built up an immunity to the poison.
However, this did not come easy. He was bitten fatally about 20 times. His hands were disfigured and mangled after close encounters with these poisonous predators.
Over the years, Bill Haast saved many lives. He traveled around the world and donated his antibody-rich blood to 21 snake bite victims.
12. If all the observable stars in the galaxy were divided up among our population, everyone would have 44.1 trillion stars. Just the thought of that makes me happy.
13. Two hours after doctors pronounced him dead, a premature baby was brought back to life by his mother?™s cuddles.


Kate Ogg gave birth to twins ??a boy and a girl ??at 27 weeks. When she was told that her son, who weighed 2 lbs, had not made it, she could not digest what had happened.

She picked him up and pressed him to her chest, told him that his name was Jaime and that he had a little sister and held him close to herself for two hours, when he miraculously started breathing.

14. Nature?™s many mysteries! A species of frog, found in Alaska, completely freezes during the winter. While frozen, the frog stops breathing, its heart stops beating, its blood stops flowing, and it cannot move at all. However, when spring sets in, the frog?™s body thaws and normal life continues.
15. Just a spoonful of matter taken from a neutron star would weigh more that Mt. Everest or 900 pyramids of Giza. That?™s more than 5,500,000,000 mammoth tons.
16. A sheep in China gave birth to a ?˜sheep dog??that sharply resembles a dog and even plays like a hound!
Chinese farmer Liu Naiying was shocked when one of his sheep gave birth to an odd looking creature. The lamb looks a lot like a dog, despite being covered in wool. Mr. Liu admitted he was frightened at first, never having seen anything like this in the 20 years he has been raising sheep.
17. A prison in Brazil uses geese as an alarm system.
An overcrowded prison in Brazil has put in place a rather alarming security detail. It has employed two geese to alert security guards when convicts try to escape, as well as when violence breaks out.
Sobral prison warden Wellington Picanco said that the geese make a lot of noise when they sense ?˜strange movements??
18. The school of your dreams actually exists. The Sudbury Valley School in Massachusetts, U.S., has done away with a prescribed curriculum and does not conduct tests or assign homework. In fact, no classes are held unless they are requested for, by students.
But here?™s what?™s surprising ??82% of these students get accepted to college, as opposed to the 63% national public school average.

2.30538E+14,TomDispatch,230537773698519_1080035325415422,Investigators said they killed for ISIS. But were they different from ?˜regular??mass killers?,"Here's a shock, on the day after yet another terrorizing atrocity (a man with a ""long rifle"" killing four women and a man at a Macy's in a mall in Washington state and walking off): the profiles/characteristics of Islamic ""lone wolf"" killers and the usual run of mass killers in America is much the same -- disturbed individuals who feel one-down to the world.  Way too much is made of the ""Islamic"" aspect of this phenomenon in a country where such incidents are common indeed and where any disturbed person with a sense of grievance can arm himself.  (It's rarely herself.)  The weapons -- from that ""long rifle"" in the Macy's to the gun Ahmad Khan Rahami pulled on a policeman when awoken in the doorway of a building after his bombing rampage to the arsenal the Pulse nightclub killer packed -- rarely makes the headlines or becomes a major issue in such stories.  And yet the increasing ease with which you can arm and carry in this country has to be a significant factor in so many of these incidents.  It makes what might otherwise remain private fantasies into public slaughters.  Tom

""Dahir Adan, a former Apollo High School honor student, walked into a mall here last Saturday and stabbed 10 people before an off-duty police officer shot him dead. The Islamic State hailed him as one of its soldiers. The FBI has hesitated to describe Adan?™s rampage as an ideologically inspired terrorist attack and Thursday night called on witnesses ??ideally with videos ??to come forward.

""For years, FBI officials and other national security experts have said that apparent lone wolves such as Adan and Ahmad Khan Rahami, charged in last weekend?™s New York bombing, have no discernible profile that could be used to head off terrorist acts. But some counterterrorism experts who studied attackers motivated by jihadist ideology say they often exhibit traits similar to those of non-Muslim mass killers who have attacked schools, churches and workplaces.

??They share common behavioral and psychological characteristics,' said John Cohen, a criminal justice professor at Rutgers University and the former counterterrorism coordinator at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. 'They?™re the same people.'

""Many studies of mass killers show that they had serious personal or psychological issues, regardless of their motives or religious identity. They bounced from job to job, struggled to find friends or romantic partners, or felt bullied by their peers. Some had traumatic home lives. Others struggled with a profound sense of shame. Awareness of these shared traits could help focus FBI questioning of certain young men who already have come to the attention of law enforcement, these experts say.

??The attackers themselves act and feel like victims,' said Adam Lankford, a criminologist at the University of Alabama. 'Various words are used. Persecution. Discrimination. Bullying. Humiliation. Mistreatment. The sense that someone else is picking on me and is out to get me.'

""Lankford points to Omar Mateen, who pledged allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State during the rampage in which he shot and killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. The FBI investigated Mateen prior to the attack, determined he had no links to terrorism and dropped the investigation. But Lankford said there were other red flags, such as boastfulness and a craving for attention, which are often seen in mass shooters.

??Omar Mateen has more in common with Dylann Roof than he does with Osama bin Laden,' Lankford said, referring to the white supremacist who allegedly shot and killed nine black churchgoers last year in Charleston, S.C.""

A five-year-old girl is reportedly recovering this morning after surviving the attack by playing dead.
The gunman, described as a slender white male between 20 and 25, is still at large. According to reports, he sat in a prayer meeting for about an hour before standing up and opening fire on the congregation. Among the dead is Reverend Clementa C. Pinckney, the church?™s pastor and a South Carolina State Senator. According to ABC 4, six of the victims were women and three were men. The massacre is being investigated as a hate crime.
Family members also told ABC that a child present during the shooting survived by playing dead. A WSCIV reporter says the child is recovering at a local hospital today:

Jim Hoft Sep 12th, 2016 6:29 pm 90 Comments

About 50 protesters claiming to be New Black Panthers marched through the Central West End in St. Louis on Sunday.
 The march was organized for Justice for Darren Seals, a young Ferguson activist who was found shot to death inside a burning car last week.

They were carrying guns.
KMOV reported:

I will be the first to admit that I have been bitterly disappointed in President Obama's tenure. Some of the disagreements are philosophical in nature, the fact that he believes in a different America than the one I believe in, a bigger government, more bureaucratic control, income redistribution, basically a European style socialism, which, in my opinion, is doing damage to the nation that will take decades, if ever, to repair.

Political differences are nothing new and I don't think we've had a president in my adult life that I didn't disagree with on one political point or another, or in some cases, many.

The political and fiscal debacles that Obama will leave behind, while formidable, are not insurmountable, if approached with common sense and understanding of the patience and sacrifice it will take to undo the damage that's been done.

His lack of leadership is an entirely different situation. Under Obama's watch, race relations have drastically deteriorated with little or no input from the White House, as a president who went in to office with a mandate, both houses of Congress and the overwhelming good will of a majority of the American people, which together constituted a license to do just about anything he wanted, wasted opportunity after opportunity to heal America's division.

For older African Americans who thought they'd never see the day when they could vote for a black president, the hopes and expectations were through the roof, thinking that at last, here was a man who actually understood first hand what it was like being black in America, someone who could address the unique problems that only people of color could understand.

The facts and statistics bear out the reality that Obama has done little to address the problems that plague them and unemployment and professional advancement have actually shrunk under his watch.

He has stood on the sidelines and watched relations between African Americans and police worsen to the point that a faction of protesters were calling for the killing of cops.

I have to wonder what would have happened had a faction of anti-Muslim protesters had been going down the street shouting, ?œWhat do we want????œDead Muslims!???œWhen do we want them????œNow!??
It's hard to imagine the White House being silent, and I would think that the Attorney General's office would have been frantic, issuing indictments and citing hate crimes.

The leadership vacuum has extended past the domestic arena and the results are evident in the deplorable condition of America's foreign relations. The balance of power and influence has shifted in the Middle East, and we are basically, at least philosophically, at war with Russia in Syria as we work at cross purposes in relation to the Assad regime.

We are no longer feared nor even respected, as Obama has proven that his word is hollow and his resolve is weak, having no stomach for standing up to the Putins of the world and his Iranian nuclear deal is little more than a one sided sad joke that could well be the catalyst for all out nuclear war in the Middle East.

Obama will leave America a much weaker and divided nation than the one he was elected to lead. He will leave mountains of debt, fractured racial relations, a national health care plan with catastrophic provisions that won't go into effect until after he's out of office, a Democratic Party that he has moved far to the left and a seriously tarnished American dream.

Where America goes from here will be very much in doubt until November when the electorate decides if we will continue down the same path with Hillary or Bernie or if we'll attempt a change of course with one of the Republican candidates.

The choice seems to be, do we go down the drain or begin to climb a very steep hill?

America desperately needs a leader, not a follower nor a procrastinator, not breaker of promises nor a doormat. Not a poll follower, but a leader.

What do you think?

Pray for our troops and the peace of Jerusalem

God Bless America

2.54541E+14,My Favorite Gun,254541051349349_634225450047572,More School Districts Reporting Chaos As ?œWhite Privilege??Theory Infects Disiplinary System,"Seriously, Joe Clark would have laughed at this and said everyone gets punished by the same set of rules.","We were stunned to learn that chaos has been the norm in the St. Paul, Minnesota school district, due to a student disciplinary policy that replaces suspensions with time-outs, counseling and other less punitive measures.
We also learned that the controversial policy was influenced by the Pacific Educational Group (PEG), a radical San Francisco-based consulting firm that claims black students lag behind academically, and tend to have more disciplinary problems, because American K-12 education is designed to benefit white students ??aka ?œwhite privilege.??Now it?™s becoming obvious that several other large school districts around the nation are in the same situation as St. Paul.
They?™ve all instituted radical disciplinary policies to reduce the number of black student suspensions, they?™ve all experienced serious behavioral problems as a result, and they?™re all included on a recent list of PEG client school districts.
That begs a simple, disturbing question ??is PEG making a lot of money by promoting policies in public schools that lead to chaos and danger for students and staff?
In St. Paul, the media directly connected PEG to the radical new disciplinary policies that have teachers, parents and union officials complaining about a lack of safety in hallways and classrooms.
The St. Paul Pioneer Press wrote that ?œPEG?™s input has spurred district-wide changes in St. Paul, from a push to reduce suspensions to a bid to integrate students with intensive special needs into mainstream classrooms.
?œCritics say PEG?™s work has alienated some educators and, in recasting certain discipline issues as cultural misunderstandings, let disruptive students and their families off the hook.??PEG?™s connection to similarly passive disciplinary policies in the Madison, Wisconsin; Denver; Philadelphia; Los Angeles, Oakland and Portland school districts is not quite as obvious.
No news reports have surfaced claiming the organization played a direct role in encouraging school officials to adopt or implement policies that allow violent and unruly behavior to go unchecked.
But all six of those districts were included on a PEG client list that was published on the organization?™s website last October. A more recent list was pulled off the PEG website last week, following revelations about the severe disciplinary problems in St. Paul.
Meanwhile, we know that Glenn Singleton, founder and CEO of PEG, tends to excuse violent behavior committed by black students.
?œWhite educators are prone to wondering why black and brown boys are prone to fighting in school,??Singleton was quoted as saying by the American Thinker.
?œThey question why violence is taught in homes of color. Missing from this analysis however is how these boys might be affected by growing up in a white-governed country which threatens young men of color at will, distrusts their ability to succeed and follow the law, and allows daily racial stress to mount in neighborhoods, schools and classrooms.??New York Post reporter Paul Sperry, who recently published a story about soft disciplinary policies and increasing chaos in school districts around the nation, notes that the Obama administration has ordered numerous schools to reduce the number of black student suspensions.
But he has no doubt that PEG has played a significant role in convincing officials in many districts to tolerate a lot of behavior that would have been unthinkable in the past.
?œI know that PEG has had an outsized role in reshaping not only discipline policy in these districts but also curriculum ??including lesson plans, activities and materials ??as well as even hiring,??Sperry told EAGnews. ?œThey emphasize the recruitment of minority faculty and even recommend ?˜racial equity??and ?˜restorative justice??coordinators.
?œWhat?™s more, they do the racial-sensitivity training of teachers as part of professional teacher training workshops, reprogramming them to think that THEY are the problem, not the misbehaving kids, that their ?˜whiteness??and ?˜cultural insensitivity??is the reason African-American students tend to be, on average, more disruptive and violent than other students and tend to underperform academically.
?œSome of the teachers come out of the workshops sobbing. It?™s classic brainwashing. As we?™ve seen in St. Paul and Baltimore and Portland and Los Angeles and Philly and other school districts, PEG?™s race-based programs are backfiring.??The Madison, Wisconsin school district made news last week when teachers expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the district?™s one-year-old Behavioral Education Plan.
That plan was adopted to ?œreduce rates of student suspension and expulsion overall and whittle down a racial disparity that made black students eight times more likely than white students to get an out-of-school suspension last year,??according to the Capitol Times.
Now the Times is reporting that Madison teachers expressed their displeasure with the plan through a survey conducted by their union.

These questions are answered by former MI5 intelligence officer Annie Machon & Paul Jay, senior editor of The Real News Network.

Support solution-oriented, grassroots & independent media outlets by liking (Y) the following pages:
Actvism Munich: www.facebook.com/acTVism
Revolution News: www.facebook.com/RevNews","ENGLISH VIDEO: Is it possible to reform the surveillance-state? 
with Annie Machon ( Former MI5-Officer), Paul Jay (The Real News Network) & Zain Raza (Actvism Munich)

Annie Machon: ""There is a chance and I think because you have a collaborative democracy in terms of different parties having to work together rather than the first-past-the-post democracy that we have in the US and in the UK. There is a greater chance. So, go out and lobby and pressure, you know, smaller political groups.""

Paul Jay: ""The current elites who are governing and the politicians and the political military intelligence strata that represents and defends this system, are they capable of creating some reforms in term of the security state?  I think the main answer is: no. But maybe in very small ways if they turn it on each other. There was a lot of resentment the way Hoover blackmailed people with the intelligence... you know, Hoover former head of the FBI blackmailed all kinds of people. In fact what I was saying about the guy who was police chief of the LAPD, he wound up blackmailing the elite of Hollywood and LA. Yeah, you know, it was interesting when Petraeus's computer was broken into then there were some squawks. Oh! who gave permission to go into Petraeus's computer and find out he was having such and such affair and all of this.

So, you know, maybe there is certain things if they turn it on each other but I think we are at a stage now... I interviewed Ralph Nader a few months ago and I asked him: do you think that the kind of reforms that you were able to win back in the 60s, could you do it now? And he says: absolutely no. The is system is kind of beyond this kind of reforms now. The stuff that you might have been able to do 30-40 years ago. I mean I think whistle-blowers play a tremendous role they are very courageous and maybe through the efforts of whistle-blowers it will alarm sections of the elites who are not in all this security stuff and they don't want to get spied on themselves.

It's not, you know, it's possible but that is really where it's going to come from. We have to change who has power and then you can start taking on some of this issues because the system is very resilient. It can assimilate... like, what happened after Manning's revelations? Did anything change? What happened after Snowden's revelations? Did anything change? The system can assimilate a lot of this stuff because there's tremendous inertia and there is a good 20% in the United States and it's probably true in most countries of people who are doing very well thank you very much. And they don't, they are ok sacrificing their privacy if it means keeping their wealth. So we need to arouse ??as I'm saying all night ??ordinary people and through their fight for their interests this issues can start to get addressed...""",03/12/2015 00:00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Newson6.com reported that it happened at a Walmart in Bristow, Okla. on Saturday after the man entered the store claiming to be there for a cash deposit.

The suspect was apparently disguised as an armored truck driver with a bullet proof vest and a gun.

Police said the real Loomis truck came to make a scheduled pick up about 30 minutes later, and that?™s when employees realized their error.

The suspect is said to have walked off with more than $75,000 in cash. He?™s said to be driving a newer model black Chevrolet Malibu.

Federal authorities are reportedly involved in the case because of the massive size of the theft. The investigation is ongoing.

Of course, even if it is ""liberated"" by the Iraqi military (a force with, as Cockburn, points out only limited fight in it) and Shiite militias (eager to cleanse the region of Sunnis), the question is: in the style of the city of Ramadi, will it, too, be destroyed in the process of being taken, turned into rubble in a region lacking the finances at this point to rebuild much of anything?  Here's the first half of the Cockburn.  Tom

""Isis execution squads have appeared in the streets of Fallujah, a city 40 miles west of Baghdad, with orders to kill anybody trying to flee or surrender as government forces advance towards this Isis stronghold. ?œGroups of Isis fighters are saying they will kill anybody in Fallujah who leaves their house or waves a white flag,??says Ahmed al-Dulaimi, a political activist who spoke by phone to relatives and friends in the city.

""Iraqi army units started an offensive east of Fallujah on Monday morning after heavy shelling and airstrikes overnight. Mr Dulaimi said that Shia militias known as the Hashd al-Shaabi were joining in the bombardment with a home-made-rocket called ?œthe Nimr?? named after the leader of the Saudi Shia minority, Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, who was executed by the Saudi authorities in January this year.

""The loss of Fallujah, a Sunni commercial hub on the main road to Jordan, would be a serious blow to Isis. Its capture of the city so close to Baghdad at the beginning of 2014 was the extremist Sunni movement?™s first spectacular military victory. An interesting development on Monday was a report that three Isis gunmen were killed inside Fallujah which would be a first sign of armed resistance by local people to Isis.

""The Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi claimed a ?œbig success??by his troops within hours of the start of the operation. Wearing the black uniform of Iraq?™s counter-terrorism forces he said that it had already achieved ?œmore than was planned??as he met with commanders of the Fallujah Operational Command. Earlier in a television address on Sunday night, he pledged to ?œtear up the black banners of strangers who usurped the city.??
""Mr Abadi is under intense popular pressure in Baghdad to drive Isis out of Fallujah after bomb attacks on civilian targets earlier in the month that killed at least 200 people. ?œRightly or wrongly people in Baghdad believe these bombs are coming out of Fallujah and they want the city taken,??says a retired senior Iraqi official. The failure of government forces to expel Isis from a city so close to the capital for over two years has for long discredited its claims that it is defeating Isis.

""The Iraqi armed forces are short of combat-ready soldiers and they are reliant on two brigades of well-trained and experienced counter-terrorist troops numbering about 5,000 men. In addition, there are two divisions of the regular army able to fight, but military success over the last year has been dependent on support from the US-led air coalition which destroys Isis positions while Iraqi troops act as a mopping up force.""

I simply want to state once again ??really, I want to shout it from the rooftops ??that perception does not change reality, and so Bruce Jenner is no more a woman than Rachel Dolezal is black.
In the last week, a steady stream of articles has drawn comparisons, both positive and negative, between Jenner and Dolezal, with not a few stating that Dolezal?™s actions are harmful to the transgender cause. (The opening lines of Ben Shapiro?™s fairly comprehensive article, detailing many other claims made by Dolezal and dripping with sarcasm, are classic.)
Obviously, I have no idea whether Dolezal (below) genuinely believes she is black or simply chooses to identify as black ??but what?™s clear, if all the reports are true, is that she is not black.
How can I be so dogmatic?
It?™s because skin color is verifiable.
It is not based on perception.
It is not based on feelings.
It is based on provable data.
The same is true when it comes to gender (again, putting aside the question of how to best help those with biological or genetic abnormalities that are not so easily categorized as male or female).
Some people are genetically and biologically male while others are genetically and biologically female, and to alter their physical appearance through cosmetic surgery no more changes their real identity than wearing leopard skins transforms a human being into a big cat.
The same is true when it comes to hormonal treatments: You can pump up Bruce Jenner with all the female hormones in the world but that does not make him into a woman. (To date, we have not been presented with any evidence that he is a genetic female in any form.)

In Baltimore and beyond, Gray's name became a rallying cry

BALTIMORE ??A year after the death of Freddie Gray, a small part of his legacy can be seen at a southwest Baltimore recreation center, where the pounding of basketballs and squeak of sneakers echo off the walls as young black men in shorts and sweats face off.

Ken Hurst, a white policeman, watches from the side, a bum knee the only thing that keeps him from playing. He visits the game each week, not to make arrests but to make friends. ""I need them to realize I'm not out here to lock everyone up,"" he says. ""I'm here to rebuild trust.""

Seldom in the city's history has that trust been so tenuous: Gray, a 25-year-old black man from West Baltimore, died after his neck was broken April 12 in the back of a police van. Protests erupted and long-simmering tensions between the police and residents exploded into the worst riots and looting in more than four decades. The U.S. Department of Justice announced an investigation into allegations of unlawful arrests and excessive force.

In Baltimore and beyond, Gray's name became a rallying cry, representative of black men's mistreatment by police officers, and of the Baltimore department's own failings.

Police commissioner Anthony Batts was fired. His deputy ??and replacement ??Kevin Davis ??promised to repair a relationship with the community that was so strained some say it's safer to run from police than take a chance on interacting with them. While some in the community remain skeptical, other say there has been progress.

Davis has implemented a mandatory, 40-hour community patrol class that teaches officers in training ??and eventually, all officers ??how to engage residents. Davis said he has also begun honoring officers each week for demonstrating ""guardianship"" ??for forging strong bonds with residents, rather than making arrests.

""That's how far we've come this year,"" he says. ""Would that have happened before Freddie Gray? Probably not.

""We can no longer just go occupy a geography, a poor minority neighborhood, and stop 300 people in the hopes of catching 10 bad guys,"" Davis said. ""We're also looking at who we're hiring ... Are we hiring people with a service mind set, or people who watch too many cops and robbers television shows?""

Another initiative, the one that brought Hurst to the rec center, aims to get more officers out of their cars and walking the streets of Baltimore's most crime-ridden neighborhoods as full-time patrol officers.

Howard Hood is a 22-year-old black man who was born and raised in the neighborhood Hurst patrols, and he shows up to the rec center every Tuesday night.

""Not all cops want to see us dead or in jail. We need more officers to come out and feel comfortable being around us,"" he says.

An hour earlier, Hurst, blue-eyed with tanned skin and an easy smile, was walking along a commercial strip in the Irvington neighborhood, dotted with corner stores, liquor stores, cheap restaurants and a massive thrift shop. Spotting a group of young men loitering near a bus shelter, he gently but firmly told them to move along.

As he strolled down the block, a car stopped in the middle of the road and a young man popped his head out of the passenger window.

""Whassup Hurst?"" he shouts, his smiling lips parted to reveal teeth plated with gold veneers.

As part of his routine, Hurst walks to a cellphone store to check in on the manager. On the way, 45-year-old Keith Hopkins, who sat in a wheelchair, a hand-rolled cigarette between his fingers, stopped the officer to chat.

""Hurst don't need a gun or a badge around here,"" he says. ""He's one of the good ones.""

In 2015, the city experienced the most violent year in its history, and the Southwestern District, Hurst's post, saw 51 killings ??the most of any precinct except the Western District, where Gray was arrested.

""Police officers, a lot of them think that every guy standing on the corner is dealing drugs, which isn't true,"" Hurst said. ""And the community, a lot of them out here think every police officer coming up to them is going to make them sit on the ground and cuss at them and treat them badly.""

Community mistrust of police in Baltimore dates back decades. Former Gov. Martin O'Malley, mayor from 1999-2006, instituted a ""zero tolerance"" crime-fighting strategy that advocated ""stop and frisk"" practices and cracking down on lower-level crimes such as public drunkenness and disorderly conduct. In 2005, more than 100,000 people were arrested ??roughly one sixth of the city's population??and a Baltimore grand jury found excessive arrests in poor black neighborhoods.

The city paid $870,000 to settle a lawsuit by people who said they were illegally arrested, and O'Malley's successors have moved away from zero-tolerance policing. The police commissioner says those days are over, but the hangover lingers.

Dorothy Cunningham, 58, the president of the Irvington Community Association, was instrumental in getting Hurst assigned to her district. Hurst, an eight-year veteran, is beloved in the neighborhood, and has already helped residents feel safer, she says.

""Maybe the police learned something from the unrest in the spring,"" Cunningham says.

Other officers struggle to blend into the communities they patrol, where residents are still fearful of police and critical of the department.

Across town, Jordan Distance, a black officer, walks a commercial strip surrounded by blocks dotted with abandoned buildings and vacant homes. The day before, five people were shot, one fatally, on his beat. The police had yet to identify a suspect.

""The shooting last night, there's so many vacants and alleys and nobody's going to tell me what he looks like,"" he says.

""There's that disconnect between us and the people. I don't know if it's because they're scared or what.""

For Hurst, policing is only one aspect of the job. He hands out flyers advertising jobs and is helping transform a vacant property into a community center, complete with a computer lab, a police substation and workshop space.

""There's a guy who said, I'll come and teach them carpentry. Another guy in the neighborhood said he'd come in and help them with their homework,"" Hurst says.

""We'll put in a garden and when the vegetables are ripe we'll pick them and pass them out. We're trying,"" he says, ""we're trying our best.""

The creator directed attention to the wide world of race baiting that only benefits news ratings and race profiteers like Al Sharpton ??specifically highlighting the ?œhands up, don?™t shoot??movement and hand gesture that acted as the driving force behind months of race rioting.
And the worst part, as pointed out, was that the narrative was completely false. Michael Brown, who attempted to murder former police officer Darren Wilson, never once had his hands up in surrender. Rather, he charged Wilson like a bull in an attempt to gain control of Wilson?™s firearm.
?œYou have liberals and many poor blacks backing up this fantasy story with White House officials showing up to Michael Brown?™s funeral. A criminal who physically intimidated a store clerk while robbing him and then attacking the police officer in his vehicle,??the video?™s narrator explained.
The video also mentioned the media?™s quick assumptions to spark a false narrative, like the ?œwhite male, George Zimmerman??report that was immediately pushed by left-leaning media outlets, when in fact Zimmerman was Hispanic.
While the narrator admitted that police brutality does exist and shows a number of dash-cam videos that show police officers committing such acts against people of all skin colors, he explained that the real problem, the real issue that so-called ?œactivists??like Sharpton need to get behind, is the growing epidemic of black-on-black violence.

It took Jeannette's K-9 officer, Arees, a few minutes to get used to his new outfit.

When Officer Jim Phillips strapped his partner into a donated protective vest, Arees walked a little off-balance while adjusting to the extra few pounds and constriction.

But the black piece of armor that arrived Saturday is now a comfortable part of Arees' uniform.

?œThis vest is made to fit him,??Phillips said.

The 3-year-old, dual-purpose German shepherd has been on the job for a little over a year. He is trained in patrols and narcotics detection.

?œThe patrol aspect of it is probably when he would be in the most danger,??Phillips said.

The bullet- and stab-resistant vest was sent to the city by Vested Interest in K9s, a Massachusetts charity that provides K-9 officers with protection. Donations solicited through the organization's website footed the approximately $2,000 bill for Arees.

?œThey're officers, also,??police Chief Shannon Binda said. ?œSo why shouldn't they be able to be protected???
Arees has participated in school locker searches and was sent to New Florence in November to help search for a suspect accused of gunning down a police officer.

?œHe's been involved in a lot of search warrants and a lot of arrests,??Phillips said.

Embroidered on the chest area of the vest are the words: ?œIn memory of K-9 Rocco, Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.??
Rocco, a German shepherd, was killed in January 2014 while assisting Pittsburgh police during an arrest. A suspect attempting to elude police is serving time for stabbing the dog in the back in the basement of a Lawrenceville home.

Six months later, ?œRocco's Law??was enacted, increasing the penalties for killing a police animal.

Pittsburgh Port Authority K-9 Aren was stabbed to death last month while assisting in an arrest in Wilkinsburg. Aren, a German shepherd, died from a head wound.

Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Now he wants to take that away too.","The Obama administration is moving forward with regulations designed to help diversify America?™s wealthier neighborhoods, drawing fire from critics who decry the proposal as executive overreach in search of an ?œunrealistic utopia.??A final Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) rule due out this month is aimed at ending decades of deep-rooted segregation around the country.
The regulations would use grant money as an incentive for communities to build affordable housing in more affluent areas while also taking steps to upgrade poorer areas with better schools, parks, libraries, grocery stores and transportation routes as part of a gentrification of those communities.
?œHUD is working with communities across the country to fulfill the promise of equal opportunity for all,??a HUD spokeswoman said. ?œThe proposed policy seeks to break down barriers to access to opportunity in communities supported by HUD funds.??It?™s a tough sell for some conservatives. Among them is Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), who argued that the administration ?œshouldn?™t be holding hostage grant monies aimed at community improvement based on its unrealistic utopian ideas of what every community should resemble.???œAmerican citizens and communities should be free to choose where they would like to live and not be subject to federal neighborhood engineering at the behest of an overreaching federal government,??said Gosar, who is leading an effort in the House to block the regulations.
Civil rights advocates, meanwhile, are praising the plan, arguing that it is needed to break through decades-old barriers that keep poor and minority families trapped in hardscrabble neighborhoods.
?œWe have a history of putting affordable housing in poor communities,??said Debby Goldberg, vice president at the National Fair Housing Alliance.
The Fair Housing Act of 1968 prohibited direct and intentional housing discrimination, such as a real estate agent not showing a home in a wealthy neighborhood to a black family or a bank not providing a loan based on someone?™s race.
But HUD is looking to root out more subtle forms of discrimination that take shape in local government policies that unintentionally harm minority communities, known as ?œdisparate impact.???œThis rule is not about forcing anyone to live anywhere they don?™t want to,??said Margery Turner, senior vice president at the left-leaning Urban Institute. ?œIt?™s really about addressing long-standing practices that prevent people from living where they want to.???œIn our country, decades of public policies and institutional practices have built deeply segregated and unequal neighborhoods,??Turner said.
Children growing up in poor communities have less of a chance of succeeding in life, because they face greater exposure to violence and crime, and less access to quality education and health facilities, Turner suggested.
?œSegregation is clearly a problem that is blocking upward mobility for children growing up today,??she said.
To qualify for certain funds under the regulations, cities would be required to examine patterns of segregation in neighborhoods and develop plans to address it. Those that don?™t could see the funds they use to improve blighted neighborhoods disappear, critics of the rule say.
The regulations would apply to roughly 1,250 local governments.
Hans von Spakovsky, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation, called the Obama administration ?œtoo race conscious.???œIt?™s a sign that this administration seems to take race into account on everything,??Spakovsky said.

are brutally attacking veterans 

Another U.S. Marine veteran 
was brutally attacked in our nation's capital, Fox and Friends reported this morning. 
 
Marine Cpl. Michael Schroeder, 35, was knocked unconscious and left for dead in freezing weather in northwest D.C. 

He laid on the ground for hours between two parked cars, bleeding from his head, before Good Samaritans saw him and called 911.

Schroeder said he doesn't remember much about the attack, which occurred sometime before 2am as he walked home after a night out with friends.

Police have no suspects.

More than $23,000 has been raised on a GoFundMe page to help Schroeder.

According to that page, Schroeder's neurologist believes he will make a full recovery, though it will take two months and require extensive therapy.

He suffered a severe concussion and a fractured skull, among other injuries.

The creator of the fundraising page explained that Schroeder, who served in Iraq and is no longer active-military, had been seeking a job before the attack and is uninsured.

The attack happened Feb. 12, the same day as an assault on decorated Marine Sgt. Christopher Marquez outside a D.C. McDonald's, though police say the two events are not connected.

Two teens were arrested for beating and robbing Marquez in an attack that was caught on surveillance video.

Marquez said on Fox and Friends earlier this week that the teens who attacked him should face hate crime charges. 

He said that the juveniles repeatedly asked him if he believed ""black lives matter"" before attacking him from behind as he left the restaurant.

Days before, Laxamana?™s father Jeff had reportedly punished her for an unspecified transgression by cutting off her hair and uploading a video to YouTube. There?™s now a controversy brewing","Izabel Laxamana, a 13-year-old girl in Tacoma, Washington died by suicide after jumping off a highway overpass on Friday, May 29. Days before, Laxamana?™s father Jeff had reportedly punished her for an unspecified transgression by cutting off her hair and uploading a video to YouTube. There?™s now a controversy brewing online and among the girl?™s friends and family over whether the video caused her death.
Tacoma?™s News Tribune reports that the girl, who they don?™t identify by name, exited a car andjumped off a bridge onto Interstate 5. She was taken to a Seattle hospital, where she died on Saturday. Friends of the Laxamana family are now raising money for funeral costs on a GoFundMe site.
The original 15-second video that is supposedly of Izabel, filmed by her father, has been removed. But one of Laxamana?™s friends shared it by taping the original on his phone:

The video opens with a shot of a short-haired girl in a black t-shirt staring blankly at the camera, in what appears to be a garage.
?œThe consequences of getting messed up, man, you lost all that beautiful hair,??a male voice can be heard saying from behind the camera. The video pans down, where long locks of black hair are scattered on the ground. ?œWas it worth it????œNo,??she responds quietly.
?œHow many times did I warn you???he asks.
?œA lot,??she replies, barely audibly.
After Izabel?™s death, a blog called Tacoma Stories claimed that the public shaming led to her suicide and constituted abuse:

Public shaming is a form of abuse. There are those who will say that it teaches a lesson. So does punching someone in the face. That doesn?™t make it okay to do to your children. My thoughts are with this young girl. I hope that she gets the help she needs. I also hope her father gets the help he so clearly needs and that her family can heal from these traumatic events brought on by public shaming.

The blog?™s author, John Cameron, added in an update that he?™d closed the comments section ?œdue to multiple requests from family members of the victim.??A Facebook page called Justice for Izabel is filled with calls for her father to be criminally prosecuted or else publicly shamed himself.
While the social media mob is busy coming for Laxamana?™s family, it?™s also important to note that determining cause and effect when it comes to suicide isn?™t easy. We have little information about what else was going on in Laxamana?™s life, although in a Google Plus post from last year, she writes about feeling bullied at school. She shares a link to a song and says it?™s what gets her through her tough times:

I feel hated most of the time im in school i feel looked down on and i get judged alot?? But what keeps me going is people like kian who have gone through the same thing as me??In a school with so many people its weird to say ?œi feel alone??but the truth is that you really do feel alone. So thanks for everything kian??

Outside Giaudrone Middle School, someone else filmed the enormous pile of flowers, stuffed animals and chalk messages that have been left by students in tribute to Laxamana:

The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If you?™re in crisis or feeling suicidal, please call 1-800-273-8255. You can also chat online with someone from NSPL at any time, day or night.

Dolezal?™s mother, Ruthanne, says the family?™s ancestry is Czech, Swedish and German, with a touch of Native American heritage.
Dolezal has identified herself in application materials as white, black and Native American.
Police say they have found little evidence of racial harassment.

James Lowe of Barnet says he was released from jury duty on Tuesday when he showed up to court wearing a black-and-white-striped jumpsuit with a matching beanie.
The Caledonian Record reports that Lowe showed up on time and joined other prospective jurors before the start of the selection process.



Crimes of fashion: James Lowe of Barnet says he was released from jury duty on Tuesday when he showed up to court wearing this black-and-white-striped jumpsuit with a matching beanie



Deputies directed him to an empty courtroom to meet with the judge, who told him to leave.
Lowe says the judge told him he could?™ve been found in contempt of court. That could?™ve meant a fine or jail time.
Lowe says the juror instructions don?™t restrict clothing, but that he?™s happy to be released because of his work schedule and family obligations.
Dailymail.com spoke with Lowe?™s wife Sheri who said that her husband didn?™t think there was a dress code.
?˜The rules said nothing about what to wear and whether or not he had to be wearing jeans or a suit and tie,??said Sheri.
Lowe bought the striped jumpsuit at a yard sale a few weeks ago and thought that jury duty would be the perfect time to wear it. Everyone was amused about his outfit but the judge, said Sheri.
?˜Everyone got some laughs that day.Everyone was having a good time. Everyone but the judge who had a sheriff escort my husband out. They told him to go home??Sheri said her husband drives trucks and because she had a stroke she is unable to work and has trouble remembering everyday things and certain numbers, including her husband?™s age.
In Vermont, jurors are paid just $11 per day, an amount Sheri says she and her husband cannot afford to make.
?˜People have families. Wives don?™t work. It?™s not fair to make someone do something if they just don?™t want to do it or if they cant,??said Sheri.
Sheri said that even if her husband were chosen for the trail, he is hard of hearing and might have trouble deliberating since he can?™t hear well or listen to an argument.??According to the jury duty FAQ on their website, ??appropriate casual dress is required,??though there is no outlined definition of what is appropriate and what is not.

There are few words in the English language that get used in more ways than the little four-letter word ?œlove.?? 
I love my wife.
 
I love my kids.
 
I love football.
 
I?™d love to be rich.
 
I love to watch the sunrise.
 
I?™d love to see him fall down and break his neck.
 
So the word love can be used in a negative connotation as well as a term of endearment. I Know??I do it too, we all do, but did you ever stop and think about the true meaning of love, and with all due respect, not the one in Mr. Webster?™s dictionary, but the one in the Word of God, the Book of 1 Corinthians Chapter 13.
 
The author, Paul, says that even if he could speak with the tongues of men and angels but did not love people, his words would mean no more that a cymbal crash. That if he had the gift of prophecy, could fathom all mysteries and had all knowledge and even had faith that could move mountains, he would still be nothing without love.
 
Let me quote verse 4 directly:
 
?œLove is patient, love is kind, it does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no records of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.?? 
He goes on to say that prophecies will cease and knowledge will pass away but love goes on forever, and that love is even greater than faith and hope.
 
When we look at Paul?™s description of love we can see how far we have drifted from God?™s standards.
 
Paul says love is patient.  
 
We, and I mean this collectively - including myself - have basically run out of patience. We want what we want and we want it right now and heaven help the service person or the worker at the fast food place who stands in our way of getting it right now.
 
Love is kind.
 
Love washes the dishes occasionally, puts aside important work and takes the time to look at the drawing your first grader brought home from school and is so proud of.
 
Love is not envious. 
 
It rejoices when one of our friends accomplishes something, instead of saying, ?œThat should have been me. Why him? ?œHe?™s no smarter than I am,??we are supposed to be happy for our friend?™s good fortune.
 
Love doesn?™t boast.
 
When you see old friends say at a high school reunion are you ever tempted to let everybody know just how successful you?™ve been in your life, the house you live in or the car you drive or just how wonderful your son?™s college grades are.
 
Love does not dishonor others.
 
Love does not lord it over other people just because you can. In fact - in my humble opinion - the way you treat other people is the measuring stick as to what kind of person you really are.
 
Love does not fly off the handle and understands about the daughter?™s new boyfriend, the son?™s first speeding ticket, the grandchild who broke your favorite vase or the black sheep of the family who is always in some kind of trouble.
 
Love protects and trusts and the institution of marriage is built on those two principles. Marriage is about protecting your loved one, protecting them from harm, from hurt, from anything the world brings to your doorstep, and without trust there can be no successful marriage.
 
When we look at God?™s definition of ?œlove??we can realize just how deep his perfect love for us goes. He wants us to love each other just like He loves us, and oh people, just think about just what a wonderful world we?™d live in if we would.
 
There is an old song that goes, ?œWhat the world needs now is love sweet love.?? 
I couldn?™t agree more.
 
What do you think?
 
Pray for our troops and the peace of Jerusalem.
 
God Bless America

7.9954E+14,Shaun King,799539910084929_961968183842100,King: Police brutality cases need to be investigated quicker,"On Dec. 2, 2015, two violent extremists opened fire at an office holiday party in San Bernardino, Calif., killing 14 and injuring at least 22 others. It was one of the deadliest mass shootings in American history. It has been treated as the emergency situation that it truly is.

Hundreds of investigators have been deployed from local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. Dozens of people of interest have been interviewed, social networks have been scoured, no stone has been left unturned. On Thursday, a neighbor, Enrique Marquez, was arrested and charged with three federal crimes including providing material support to a terrorist, immigration fraud and making a false statement relative to the purchase of a firearm.

The speed of the investigation is a marvel.

What it shows is that when victims are truly valued, and violent people are labeled in a way that society despises, the mechanisms of government can actually move very swiftly toward justice.

I noted previously how police and prosecutors alike are fully able to investigate, arrest and charge a suspect who kills a police officer ??even if no videos or eyewitnesses exist ??sometimes in a matter of 48 to 72 hours. This isn't a problem. This is how it should be. The same is true for swift justice in San Bernardino.

My problem, and the problem that has been at the very root of protests all over the country, is that police brutality is simply not treated with anything like the swift, efficient, comprehensive justice we see when someone is labeled a terrorist or when the victims, like police officers, are deeply valued.

The evidence of this gap is abundant.

It's why 1,356 complaints of racial profiling or bias were filed against the LAPD and there was no bias found in any.

It's why 1,065 days after college student Jayvis Benjamin was killed by police outside of Atlanta that the case against the officer is still pending.

It's why police investigators in Chicago saw the video of Laquan McDonald being murdered by Officer Van Dyke just a few days after he was killed, and knew full well that it didn't match the police reports, but simply sat on the video, and the case, for more than 400 days until a judge forced the video out.

It's why the case against the officers who killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice is now stretching into its third calendar year.

In Chicago this year, thousands of complaints have been filed against police officers. Few complaints have been upheld.

My evidence is anecdotal, but if you ask many African-Americans who frightens them more, police officers or ISIS, you're going to get a shockingly high percentage of black folks who say police. I once did a Twitter survey and asked people to describe how they feel when they simply see a police officer or see a police car on the road, and, without fail, the overwhelming majority of African-Americans described a fear, a terror even, a nervousness, to even be in the presence of police.

Police brutality is indeed its own unique form of terrorism.

Who do you call when you see it? Who do you tell when you experience it?

After multiple women were raped and sexually assaulted by Oklahoma officer Daniel Holtzclaw, they all mentioned how they just didn't know who to call or how to report such a crime when an officer of the law was the perpetrator.

I've gotten to the point where I've resigned myself to the fact that our government knows how to handle injustice and violence when it cares, it just appears when it comes to police brutality, it could hardly care less.

7.9954E+14,Shaun King,799539910084929_1120767237962193,SHAUN KING: Racism in America is getting worse. Measurably so. Ask Leslie Jones.,"A frequent refrain I hear as I travel the country is that the problems of American racism, bigotry and police brutality aren't actually getting worse ??that social media is simply amplifying old problems, making them more visible, giving us the false impression that matters are getting worse when they aren't.

This is a lie. It's an urban legend. It's not based on any data or research or interviews, but a fundamental denial that we live in a valley of racism and bigotry in America. And it's getting worse.

Ask the comedian Leslie Jones, who has been bombarded for weeks by non-stop racist attacks, for no reason other than being a black woman in ?œGhostbusters.??She has been bullied and hacked and demonized by bigots 24 hours a day.

Ask America's prison population, which has grown 1,000% from 200,000 inmates in 1973 to over 2.2 million today.

Ask the thousands of families whose loved ones have been killed by American police. 2015 was the deadliest year of police violence ever measured.

Ask the Charleston, S.C., families of Emanuel AME, affected last year by the deadliest hate crime against African-Americans in nearly 100 years.

Ask the young students in Kentucky, Indiana, Iowa, California and Missouri, who experienced bigoted attacks firsthand, if they are just imagining things getting worse.

Ask experts about the growth of hate groups in this country since the year 2000.

Ask the 10-year-old boy in Newark ??who was swarmed by police with guns drawn because they claimed they thought he was a 20-year-old robbery suspect ??if he thinks things are getting worse.

Every day I receive at least a few hundred racist messages on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, email and even in regular mail in the Daily News offices. They often include threats of violence and death. I have increased my life-insurance policy. At a recent gathering of family and friends, I overheard my loved ones speaking about their concerns that I would be assassinated before I turned 40. I'm 36. It was a surreal and painful moment.

It appears many Americans have confused the hyper-visibility of African-Americans like President Obama and Oprah Winfrey with a decline in racism. One, by no means, equals the other. In fact, if anything, it appears the increased visibility of some American black folk has actually caused an ugly increase in racism. Like no President before him, Obama has had to defend his very humanity and citizenship.

The man who was the most visible leader of this sickening movement is now the Republican nominee for President.

Donald Trump is not an accident, but a distinct reflection of the times we are living in. He is the most bigoted and offensive man to be the nominee of a major American party in this generation ??maybe ever. With Election Day less than three months away, Trump appointed the head of Breitbart News as the new CEO of his campaign. No national platform has advanced bigotry more in the past few years than Breitbart.

Again, we're not all imagining things getting worse ??they are.

Social media itself is not new. Facebook launched in 2004, and Twitter in 2006. Both were fully mainstream by 2010. The time we are in right now feels different and more bigoted than any of those years ??because it is different and more bigoted.

Sometimes, the world gets worse. Right now is one of those times.

A Providence, Rhode Island police officer 
claims he was handed a cup of coffee by a Dunkin??Donuts worker on October 2 that had the words ??BlackLivesMatter??written on it. 

Dunkin??Donuts corporate office has confirmed that the incident did occur and that the female employee who did it ?œhas been counseled about her behavior.??
According to WCVB 5, Lt. Roger Aspinall commented on the slogan by saying it is tied to a movement that ?œcondones violence against police.??The officer who was actually handed the cup also referenced being treated rudely by a store employee.

The Fraternal Order of Police described the incident as ?œunacceptable and discouraging.??
Dunkin??Donuts responded to news of the incident by releasing a statement, in which they said:

??""We are aware of the situation in Providence. Dunkin Donuts and our franchisees share a commitment to the well-being and fair treatment of all our guests. 

The franchise owner has apologized to the police officer on behalf of Dunkin Donuts, and he has counseled the employee about her behavior.

pleads guilty to string of murders
--spanning decades, from sea to shining sea 

A man who allegedly told authorities 
he had been a hit man for a Mexican drug cartel has been extradited to California to face multiple counts of murder for a string of killings that plagued the Central Valley for three decades, officials said Friday.

Jose Manuel Martinez, nicknamed ""El Mano Negro,"" or the black hand, had been housed at an Alabama prison, where he was serving a 50-year sentence for the March 2013 shooting death of Jose Ruiz.  
  
Authorities from the Central Valley, however, worked with the U.S. Marshal's Service to bring Martinez, 52, to California on Wednesday to face charges for shooting, sometimes stabbing, nine men to death, according to the Tulare County Sheriff's Department.

Some of the men's bodies were found in ranchers' fields and orange groves throughout the Central Valley. 
 
The California killings began in the 1980s 
in Tulare County, then moved through parts of Kern and Santa Barbara counties, ending in 2011 where it started. 

Authorities say Martinez, a self-described enforcer for an unnamed Mexican drug cartel, is also a person of interest for homicides in Florida and nine other states. 
 
In California, Martinez is charged 
with nine felony counts of murder and a count of attempted murder -- all which were allegedly done for financial gain.

Prosecutors also alleged Martinez was lying in wait and kidnapped some of his victims.

One of the nine men was 29-year-old Domingo Perez, who had been reported missing by his family in 1995 and was later found dead with multiple gunshot wounds in an orange grove north of Richgrove in Tulare County. 

Santiago Perez, 56, of Pixley was at home with his four children when he was shot to death in his bed on Feb. 14, 2000.

""If you want to witness an adamantine (unbreakable) mind at work, you could do a lot worse that observe the 44th president of the United States. Barack Obama is the most rigidly ideological president of my lifetime, a man who has a nearly blind adherent to a particular ideology (progressivism). It?™s a disturbing, if at times a psychologically fascinating, thing to witness.

We?™re seeing it play out in multiple ways, but let me offer just one illustration ??his approach to jihadism. It has been clear from the start of his presidency that Mr. Obama has decided that Islam is wholly separate from Islamic terrorism, which explains his refusal to use the words (or variations of the words) radical or militant Islam. It also explains why his administration has used absurd euphemisms like ?œman-caused disaster??and ?œworkplace violence??to describe Islam-inspired attacks. Why the 2009 Christmas Day bomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, was an ?œisolated extremist.??Why the shooting at a Kosher supermarket in Paris earlier this year was ?œrandom.??(The gunman had declared his allegiance to ISIS.) And why the president, in an effort to protect Islam, invokes the Crusades at a National Prayer Breakfast, despite the fact that the Crusades happened roughly a thousand years ago. On and on it goes.

We have a president who is eager to put a racial frame around incidents in which white cops kills blacks, even if, as in the case of Officer Darren Wilson and Michael Brown, the shooting was justified and there was no evidence that it was racially motivated. No matter; the incidents fit into Mr. Obama?™s worldview, and off to 
the races he went.""

Nearly 10,000 soldiers, many of whom served multiple combat tours, have been ordered to repay large enlistment bonuses ??and slapped with interest charges, wage garnishments and tax liens if they refuse ??after audits revealed widespread overpayments by the California Guard at the height of the wars last decade.??Roughly 30 million needs to be paid back, meanwhile the Pentagon?™s black budget, taxpayer money fueling the unconstitutional Shadow Government, rose from 52.6 Billion in 2013 to 59 Billion in 2015.",,27/10/2016 00:00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Told that the image of the Jacksonville Sheriff?™s Office is not minority-friendly, Sheriff Mike Williams said changes made in job-qualification standards will help increase the pool of candidates, including minorities, who will be eligible for police academy training.

In October the sheriff scrapped a policy that required a four-year college degree for recruits and opened the academy to recruits with backgrounds in the military, law enforcement and other areas but do not have the degree.

At a meeting Monday of a committee tasked with providing training advice, committee member Yvette Hyater-Adams told Williams the agency is lacking when it comes to attracting the involvement of minorities.

Hyater-Adams, who is black, said she and her husband mentor black youths and said when given an opportunity to meet with police at a Christmas event, the youths balked.

?œThey didn?™t want to spend a day with a police officer,??she said.

She said she has noticed a disconnect with minorities even on the Sheriff?™s Office Facebook page, which she said gives a too-white complexion when seen from the outside.

?œWhat I usually see, and what I am looking at on our JSO Facebook page, you see some ?˜atta-boys,???˜atta-girls??in there but when you look at the people that are commenting, they are mostly our white citizens, obviously absent of people of color,??Hyater-Adams said.

The committee, one of four that also includes groups looking at transparency, resources and community engagement, will be investigating how other police departments handle training at a variety of levels. The four committees will present the sheriff with recommendations in the coming months.

Williams said he hopes changing the path to becoming a police officer by no longer tying it to a four-year college degree will ease difficulty the Sheriff?™s Office has in attracting candidates.

The change in standards, adding avenues including years of military service or public safety and other experience-related backgrounds as qualifications in addition to the degree, will open the doors to more people, including minorities, he said.

Now about 30 percent to 35 percent of the Sheriff?™s Office staff are black and about 5 percent Hispanic, he said.

That mirrors the city, he said.

?œOur overall numbers in the agency look good,??he told the committee. ?œBut when you look at the sworn force, the police side of the house, take corrections out of it, we?™re low. We?™re not where we should be.??
Statistics provided by the department show 40 percent of corrections officers are black and 54 percent white. The ranks of sworn police officers are 18 percent black and 74 percent white. The numbers do not include civilian employees of the department.

When civilians are included, the department makeup is approximately 64 percent white, 28 percent black and 5 percent Hispanic as of March 1, according to statistics provided by the Sheriff's Office. Other minorities make up the remainder.

Williams said the agency, which has a starting salary of $38,000 after training, cannot compete on college campuses when more lucrative careers in finance or other businesses offer more.

By including combinations of education and experience, such as four years of military or law enforcement experience or two years of military and a two-year degree as well as other paths, the Sheriff?™s Office can pull in applicants with experience that may prove more helpful than a college education.

?œThis allows us, the changes in our requirements, to reach into our jail and you get a young man who has worked in the jail for four years, that is four years of law enforcement experience, he now can apply and become a police officer,??Williams said.

?œIf they?™ve got that track record, there is no reason why he or she couldn?™t make that transition.??
He recounted a case involving a hopeful candidate who had been a U.S. Marine, served in Iraq and Afghanistan and had to leave the service because he donated a kidney to his sister so he no longer was qualified to be in the military. He didn?™t qualify for the police academy because at the time he did not have the required education in the old system, Williams said.

He said the Sheriff?™s Office can assist officers who want to pursue a degree and those wishing to rise to lieutenant or above must have one. But life experience can be a vital part of a person?™s qualifications, he said.

?œThis is clearly a profession, but it is a working profession,??he said. ?œYou are going to get sweaty, and dirty and sometimes bloody.??
Often, those with only a degree have not had the kind of experience that lends itself to those rigors, he said.

The requirement for a college degree was instituted by former Sheriff Nat Glover, who was elected sheriff in 1995 and said he believed that level of education provided for a more rounded officer.

It also came on the heels of a 1994 grand jury investigation that made a recommendation that officers eventually have college degrees. The grand jury investigation followed a year in which 12 officers were charged with crimes ranging from rape to indecent exposure and included two arrests in a drug-planting scandal.

The national party also affirmed a resolution supporting same-sex marriage in every state and another honoring the son of Vice President Joe Biden, Beau Biden, who passed away in May.

It also calls for Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform, and calls for minimizing the use of ?œweapons that were used to police peaceful civilians in the streets of Ferguson, Missouri??last summer.
  23 police officers have been killed this year in the line of duty.
652 people have been shot dead by police so far this year; 24 were black and unarmed.

You cannot have people that believe that Sharia law in the employ to enforce our own laws.

Assistant Chief Anita Najiy did what she was required to do according to U.S. Military Code, say police department leaders but Fraternal Order of Police President Javier Ortiz wants Najiy reprimanded for not saluting the flag or covering her heart during the Pledge of Allegiance.
?œSince she clearly has no respect for the flag or the United States, on behalf of the Fraternal Order of Police, I am requesting that Assistant Chief Najiy is removed as the commander of the MPD Honor Guard Detail,??Ortiz said in a letter Monday to Police Chief Rodolfo Llanes.
That?™s not likely to happen. Though the police department?™s code of conduct allows for a reprimand if an officer doesn?™t salute the flag, it makes no mention of covering your heart during the Pledge of Allegiance. And not a single member of the command staff standing next to Najiy last week saluted the flag during the ceremony.
Police Maj. Delrish Moss produced a section of the conduct code for U.S. military personnel, which he says supercedes police code. It reads: ?œWhen in uniform, indoors, stand at attention, remain silent, and face the flag.??
Najiy did not respond to an interview request Tuesday. Neither did Ortiz, who produced the 23-second video showing Najiy at attention during last week?™s ceremony, then launched it into the social media biosphere.

 A pastor on the South Side is asking Republicans to talk to his flock after what he says are 50 years of disappointment from the other party.

 CHICAGO ??It is difficult to imagine a less likely GOP presidential campaign stop than O Block. 

 After all, it?™s the most dangerous stretch of Martin Luther King Jr. Drive in Chicago and one of the toughest territories in the city. 

 But if Republicans stand a chance of chipping away at Democrats??dominance over the black vote in this city and elsewhere, it might be something to consider.

Look around the neighborhood that contains O Block?”Woodlawn?”and you?™ll see why, Brooks said.

?œWe have a large, disproportionate number of people who are impoverished. We have a disproportionate number of people who are incarcerated, we have a disproportionate number of people who are unemployed, the educational system has totally failed, and all of this primarily has been under Democratic regimes in our neighborhoods,??Brooks said from the office of New Beginnings Church of Chicago, his own, Wednesday morning. ?œSo, the question for me becomes, how can our neighborhoods be doing so awful and so bad when we?™re so loyal to this party who is in power?

In today's New York Times, Thomas B. Edsall argues that populism is gaining strength among Democrats, Republicans and independents. As evidence, he sites a graph from Drew Westen, a professor of Psychology at Emory University, showing how voters of both parties and independents responded positively (in focus groups, using hand-held metered dials), as the following one-minute and 15 second statement was read aloud:

""The American dream used to mean something ??that you could count on good American wages and benefits for a hard day?™s work. But that?™s changing as big corporation have been shipping our jobs overseas and lobbyists have been rewriting all the rules. In just the last eight years, the average white family has lost about one-eighth of its wealth and seen its income drop for the first time in 80 years. If you were African-American or Latino just starting to catch up through hard work and determination, you?™ve lost more than half of everything you put away. Ordinary people, whether white, black or brown, shouldn?™t be paying for a crash they didn?™t cause. We can?™t afford to be a nation of haves and have-nots, where young people can?™t find their first job and middle-aged construction workers may have seen their last. We can?™t afford to be a nation where white kids are living in their parents??basements, where too many young men color are living on the streets. It?™s time to return to America where everyone willing to work and play by the rules can count on a fair shot. Opportunity should knock on every door no matter how humble the home, or who lives in it. That?™s what I promised my children, that?™s the American dream.""

The Chicago Police Department announced Friday that it has reached a major settlement with the American Civil Liberties Union, under which it will submit to an independent evaluation of its controversial stop-and-frisk procedure.

The settlement comes several months after the ACLU claimed in a report that the department's use of stop and frisk unjustly targets black residents and other racial minorities. 

""We had monthslong, careful negotiations that were very productive and we're very pleased with the outcome,"" Karen Sheley, a senior staff attorney for the ACLU of Illinois who worked on the settlement, told The Huffington Post Friday. 

 The five key terms of the agreement are: 

The city and CPD will comply with the U.S. and Illinois Constitutions and the Illinois Civil Rights Act. Stops must comply with Fourth Amendment protections from unreasonable searches and seizures. To comply with the ICRA, the stop-and-frisk policy cannot ""have a disparate impact on the basis of race.""
Independent review by a former federal judge. Former federal Magistrate Judge Arlander Keys will independently review the CPD?™s stop-and-frisk policy until he determines it complies with both Constitutions and the ICRA.
Improved training and supervision of CPD officers. CPD will provide officer training aimed at ensuring that stops are lawful, and will perform more comprehensive and regular audits and reviews of stops. 
Data collection regarding stops. In the past, CPD did not have a publicly available database of stops and officers did not keep records of frisks. 
Increased transparency of data. CPD will turn over stop-and-frisk data to Keys, who will also review CPD's training procedures. Sheley called Keys' oversight ""a key component"" of the agreement.
CPD Superintendent Garry McCarthy had previously criticized the ACLU's report, released in March, as ""faulty."" But on Friday, the city's top police officer was more conciliatory.

""This unprecedented agreement with the ACLU is a demonstration of CPD's commitment to fairness, respect, transparency,"" McCarthy said. 

Over the past year, a series of violent -- and sometimes deadly -- encounters between police and black residents has prompted increased scrutiny of police tactics, such as stop and frisk, that are believed to discriminate against minorities.

The ACLU's report found that Chicago's stop-and-frisk rate was four times the highest rates of the New York City Police Department.  

A federal judge ruled in 2013 that the NYPD's use of stop and frisk violated the rights of thousands of city residents by systematically targeting black men and other minorities. 

Combined with the federal ruling, mounting public pressure -- and, later, scrutiny from Mayor Bill de Blasio once he arrived in office -- the NYPD's stop-and-frisk rates fell to historic lows, with little to no adverse impact on public safety. 

""This settlement agreement is the most robust that's been achieved on the issue of stop and frisk without a lawsuit or intervention by the Department of Justice,"" Sheley said. ""We think that's important for getting to the remedy immediately.""

Meanwhile, the mainstream media wastes no time interviewing members of the right wing press, or pseudo-scientists, in a pretend effort to get to the bottom of the supposed failings of the black community.""

""However, when white biker gang members recently opened fire on one another in Waco, leaving 9 dead and 18 injured, NBC described it as a  ?œrumble??and ?œshootout?? with no discussion of the problems within white culture that would inspire a privileged class to adopt violent tendencies, and there has been no rush to describe the gangbangers, who went on a rampage, as thugs, even though the description obviously fits.""

The property in the Richmond area is said to have been crawling with rats, black widow spiders, dog feces and 300 bottles of urine.
The remains which were removed from the house on Saturday are believed to be that of Anna Ragin who lived with her 65-year-old daughter Carolyn.


Police removed the body, believed to be that of Anna Ragin, from the property in the Richmond area of San Francisco. Authorities said the home was covered in debris, including dog feces and bottles of urine

Neighbors told The San Francisco Chronicle the mother had not been seen for years.
According to records another man, Archibald Ragin, lived at the property but died 15 years ago at the age of 101.
Carolyn, said to be a retired Pacific Bell worker, was taken to hospital after her mother?™s body was removed from the house.
Supervisor Eric Mar, a representative in charge of the area, told the Chronicle : ?˜The police captains I?™ve spoken with tell me this is the worst case of hoarding they have ever seen.??He was concerned for the health and safety of the residents, but questioned how the situation in the property could have gotten to such a point.
Mr Mar said: ?˜We certainly want seniors to stay in their communities as long as possible, but when people aren?™t getting adequate health care and attention, this is what happens.
?˜This appears to be a nightmare of what can happen when people age in place for too long,??he added. ?˜We need to identify what the triggers are for the city to step in.??He told the Daily Mail Online that he heard the body was wrapped up in a carpet and described that, from the outside, it looked like the home was abandoned.


Residents said the  woman had not been seen in years while police described it as the worst case of hoarding they had ever seen

When city workers arrived to clean up the body on Wednesday, they reportedly struggled to get in the door because the house was filled with so much debris.
The mess was said to have included mold and piles of trash that reached the ceiling.
They were forced to call in professional workers.
The Chronicle quote a firefighter saying the body was lightweight and wrapped in a blanket. It is not clear where it was discovered.

Not only was the SNL video complete garbage, making white people look like self-absorbed, moronic, racist boobs, but the article summarized by saying this about Beyone's Super Bowl half time performance: ""the song upset some people, especially white conservatives who were mad that the singer showed pride in her race and skin color"".

Informed, non kool-aid drinking, Americans, white AND black, were upset by a number of things included in Beyonce's show. Probably the most egregious was the homage patently paid to the Black Panthers Party.

The following is a very informative piece on the BPP. Included is a video of the New Black Panthers calling for the slaughter of white people.","Due to the ignorance of some comments on the Beyonce debacle with the Black Panther Party (BPP), they do kill, and they have a violent history. A cursory look at the history of the BPP reveals some of these bloody incidents.

It?™s been a long 50 years under the Panthers reign of terror in America. The Black Panthers??50 years has been marked by violence, murder, cop-killing, anti-Semitism, anti-White racism, pan-Islamism and a host of other things that are no good for any free and democratic society. Our hate of the KKK should be equal to that of the BPP. 

Several Black Panthers are now extremist Muslims and cause celebres in the Islamofascist community, like convicted, imprisoned cop-killer Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin a/k/a H. Rap Brown. Al-Amin, who bragged, ?œViolence is as American as cherry pie,??killed one sheriff?™s deputy and wounded another in March 2000. The group?“so vicious, so violent?“even savagely tortured and murdered its own. The disgusting way they tortured and dismembered their living victims was so sick, it rivals that of the Islamic terrorists we are fighting now. Ungreat minds think alike.

So there?™s really no reason whatsoever to celebrate that this group is still around. Yet, the Panther alums are not only celebrating. They?™re expecting us to buy their extremist makeover. These murderous thugs now want you to believe they are ?œactivists??and want you to see ?œa positive image.??They think donning fancy suits instead of berets and military garb will instantly erase our memory banks about their ?œactivities.??
They?™ve tried this before, with ?œBurn Baby Burn??Black Panther hot sauce. But the only thing that was burning is America under their reign of terror. You can?™t remake years of murderous thuggery with a sudden Halloween costume of the Black Martha Stewart. They never apologized for murdering innocent people, leaving cops??children fatherless, taking others??lives for nothing.

From an apologist San Francisco Chronicle piece on the 50th confab, we?™re racists because we don?™t like ?œcivil rights??groups that murder for a living.

Black Panthers shout ""Kill all white people.""

On October 28, 1967, Oakland police officer John Frey was shot to death in an altercation with Black Panther Huey P. Newton during a traffic stop. In the stop, Newton and backup officer Herbert Heanes also suffered gunshot wounds. Newton was convicted of voluntary manslaughter at trial, but the conviction was later overturned. In his book Shadow of the Panther, writer Hugh Pearson alleges that Newton, while intoxicated in the hours before he was shot and killed, claimed to have willfully killed John Frey.

On April 7, 1968, seventeen-year-old Panther national treasurer Bobby Hutton was killed, and Eldridge Cleaver, Black Panther Party Minister of Information, was wounded in a shootout with the Oakland police. Two police officers were also shot. Although at the time the BPP claimed that the police had ambushed them, several party members later admitted that Cleaver had led the Panther group on a deliberate ambush of the police officers, provoking the shoot-out. Seven other Panthers, including chief of staff David Hilliard, were also arrested. Hutton's death became a rallying issue for Panther supporters.

Violent conflict between the Panther chapter in LA and the US Organization, a rival group, resulted in shootings and beatings, and led to the murders of at least four Black Panther Party members. On January 17, 1969, Los Angeles Panther Captain Bunchy Carter and Deputy Minister John Huggins were killed in Campbell Hall on the UCLA campus, in a gun battle with members of the US Organization. Another shootout between the two groups on March 17 led to further injuries. Two more Panthers died.

In Chicago, on December 4, 1969, two Panthers were killed when the Chicago Police raided the home of Panther leader Fred Hampton. The raid had been orchestrated by the police in conjunction with the FBI. Hampton was shot and killed, as was Panther guard Mark Clark. A federal investigation reported that only one shot was fired by the Panthers, and police fired at least 80 shots. Hampton was subsequently shot twice in the head at point blank range while unconscious. 

In May 1969, three members of the BPP New Haven chapter tortured and murdered Alex Rackley, a 19-year-old member of the New York chapter, because they suspected him of being a police informant. Three party officers ??Warren Kimbro, George Sams, Jr., and Lonnie McLucas ??later admitted taking part. Sams, who gave the order to shoot Rackley at the murder scene, turned state's evidence and testified that he had received orders personally from Bobby Seale to carry out the execution. Party supporters responded that Sams was himself the informant and an agent provocateur employed by the FBI. The case resulted in the New Haven, Connecticut, Black Panther trials of 1970. Kimbro and Sams were convicted of the murder, but the trials of Seale and Erika Huggins ended with a hung jury, and the prosecution chose not to seek another trial.

In 1974, BPP leader Huey Newton and eight other Panthers were arrested and charged with assault on police officers. Newton went into exile in Cuba to avoid prosecution for the murder of Kathleen Smith, an eighteen-year-old prostitute. Newton was also indicted for pistol-whipping his tailor, Preston Callins. Although Newton confided to friends that Kathleen Smith was his ""first nonpolitical murder"", he was ultimately acquitted, after one witness's testimony was impeached by her admission that she had been smoking marijuana on the night of the murder, and another prostitute witness recanted her testimony. Newton was also acquitted of assaulting Preston Callins after Callins refused to press charges.

In October 1977 Flores Forbes, the party's assistant chief of staff, led a botched attempt to assassinate Crystal Gray, a key prosecution witness in Newton's upcoming trial who had been present the day of Kathleen Smith's murder. Unbeknownst to the assailants, they attacked the wrong house and the occupant returned fire. During the shootout one of the Panthers, Louis Johnson, was killed and the other two assailants escaped. One of the two surviving assassins, Flores Forbes, fled to Las Vegas, Nevada, with the help of Panther paramedic Nelson Malloy. Fearing that Malloy would discover the truth behind the botched assassination attempt, Newton allegedly ordered a ""house cleaning"", and Malloy was shot and buried alive in the desert. Although permanently paralyzed from the waist down, Malloy recovered from the assault and told police that fellow Panthers Rollin Reid and Allen Lewis were behind his attempted murder. Newton denied any involvement or knowledge and said the events ""might have been the result of overzealous party members"". Newton was ultimately acquitted of the murder of Kathleen Smith, after Crystal Gray's testimony was impeached by her admission that she had smoked marijuana on the night of the murder, and acquitted of assaulting Preston Callins after Callins refused to press charges.

In January 2007, a joint California state and Federal task force charged eight men with the August 29, 1971, murder of California police officer Sgt. John Young. The defendants have been identified as former members of the Black Liberation Army. Two have been linked to the Black Panthers. In 1975 a similar case was dismissed when a judge ruled that police gathered evidence through the use of torture. On June 29, 2009, Herman Bell pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the death of Sgt. Young. In July 2009, charges were dropped against four of the accused: Ray Boudreaux, Henry W. Jones, Richard Brown and Harold Taylor. Also that month Jalil Muntaquim pleaded no contest to conspiracy to commit voluntary manslaughter becoming the second person to be convicted in this case.",15/02/2016 00:00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""He made it very clear to me that all of us white liberals--guilty, well-meaning people--were merely a big flashlight cast upon the evil of racism, and the flashlight found some corners where it continued, and still continues, to live. 'Throw the light,' he told me, 'and then get out of the way. This is our battle to win.' He also told me that I expected a medal or a blowjob if I opened a door for a black woman or helped a black man get a job. 'You are a white raindrop on the desert floor of America's racism,' he told me. He was right. But I kept showing up, being the flashlight, being the raindrop, and realizing how utterly hopeless our desire to expunge our guilt was. We deserve the guilt. The guilt stays with us. A cross, an anvil, to bear for eternity.""

6276351475,KING 5,6276351475_10153207473256476,,"UPDATE: KING 5 and DISH have reached an agreement regarding DISH network?™s continued carriage of our station. We will be returning to your DISH lineup shortly. Thank you very much to all of our viewers for your patience and support.  (11:30 am Sunday)

Attention DISH Subscribers:

We?™re disappointed to notify you that KING 5 is no longer available on DISH.

For the past several months, we have worked hard to reach a fair, market-based agreement with DISH. In fact, we have extended our original deadline by eight days. This constructive approach is the same one we have used to successfully reach deals with every other cable and satellite service in the markets we serve. Before today, our station/our company has NEVER had a major distributor stop carrying our station.

Unfortunately, DISH seems to take a different approach to these negotiations. It regularly drops networks from its system. In fact, just this past August, DISH blacked out local broadcast stations in dozens of markets across the country, impacting millions of viewers. Now, our station, too, will be blacked out on DISH and our viewers will lose access to some of their favorite broadcast programs and their most watched and trusted local news, weather and sports.

Despite our frustration, we remain fully committed to reaching a deal that restores our station for DISH customers.

You can help achieve that goal. If you contact DISH and let them know you want KING 5 on air, it may persuade them to get back to negotiations. Also, you should know you have choices. KING 5 has agreements with every other provider in our area, and we are always available free over-the-air. Click here www.king5.com/dish to learn more.

Again, we wish to express our sincere regret that you are being put through this. We know that you shouldn?™t have to take sides in a dispute between two companies. You pay 100% of your bill to DISH each month and you should get 100% of your channels. Simple as that.

      -- One suspect is dead, and two others may be at large
      -- Police are looking for anyone wearing army fatigues, all black or possibly a mask
     
      FULL STORY
 
      In a city already tense following a high-profile police shooting of an African-American man, three Baton Rouge police officers were killed and three others wounded Sunday. Officials think the attack on the officers is the work of multiple gunmen.
      Police received a call of a ""suspicious person walking down with an assault rifle,"" a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. When police arrived, the shooting began.
      One of the suspects is dead. Authorities believe two others may be at large.
      ""If they are wearing army fatigues; if they are wearing all black; if they are wearing a mask; if they are wearing anything that's out there, please, give us a call,"" said Baton Rouge Police Cpl. L.J. McKneely.
      
      
      The shooting took place around 9 a.m. (10 a.m. ET) in the city of about 230,000 people. ?œThere was no talking, just shooting,"" McKneely said.
      By noon, authorities had secured the scene and were making sure there weren't any explosives left behind.
      ""After that, we're going to gather as much information as we can and work this case as best as we can to find all individuals that were involved in this,"" McKneely said.
      ""Somebody might have seen something suspicious; may know of guys plotting to do this. That's why we're reaching out to the community.""
      Since the shooting death of Alton Sterling by Baton Rouge police earlier this month, the department has worried about credible threats against officers.
      It's been an emotionally charged few days across the country because of the protests stemming from the Alton Sterling shooting, and the ambush on Dallas police officers where a sniper killed five officers.
      ""This is an unspeakable and unjustified attack on all of us at a time when we need unity and healing,"" Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said.
      Kip Holden, the mayor-president of East Baton Rouge Parish, said ""everything is moving fast.""
      ""There is still an active scene. They are investigating,"" he said. ""Right now we are trying to get our arms around everything.""",,17/07/2016 00:00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Iqbal Hessan was reportedly arrested in the early hours of May 26 on the Mississauga school?™s grounds, though police would not confirm this. Hessan faces five counts of mischief over $5,000, and break, enter and commit indictable offence. A bail hearing was held later that day.
On May 20, the Sacred Heart of Jesus statue that stands in front of the church was covered in black paint and the fingers of its outstretched arms were broken off.

#FirstDoNoHarm

Because nothing says ""good doctor"" like a total disregard for patients & informed consent coupled with terroristic retaliative behavior directed at families who choose to exercise their right to make their own healthcare decisions. (#NoteSarcasm)

Freedom, bodily integrity, & informed consent.
There is no debate.

Doctors have a duty to first, do no harm as well as to respect the rights & personal boundaries dictated by informed consent.

If that is violated, then it is battery.

Subjecting people to risky procedures as ""preventative measures"" violates the oath to first do no harm.

Any sort of attempts at justifying that is a #rapeapologist mentality that is increasingly being pushed via medical rape culture...

There's the side that has always lied, undermined informed consent & pushed dangerous, lucrative rackets - poisoning, butchering, & misleading the populace for generations.

Then there's the side that argues no one has the right to violate their bodily integrity, to force ""treatments"", poisons, modifications, or procedures without their express consent.

You do know violating informed consent is kind of... #Rapey, right?

Raggedy Ann - Facts, Fiction, and FAQs
http://www.dollkind.com/raggedy-ann-doll.shtml

The rights to refuse medical procedures that could harm or kill people have been hard won - paid for with blood, sweat, & tears. We didn't always have them, there have always been those looking to undermine them - always under the false pretenses of protecting us, & when we aren't vigilant, we rapidly lose ground. Their family's loss & grief - right at a hundred years ago, is still just as relevant today. The oppressive tactics they were subjected to, mirror those we're now facing again.

Vaccine injury deniers refer to vaccine skeptics making people aware of the risks associated with vaccines as fear mongering while their higher-ups hypocritically spend many millions of dollars and put the full force of government, media, the medical/pharmaceutical industries, etc into getting people worked into a frenzy to destroy our rights to our own medical decisions over... the measles... and if vaccines should permanently disable, brain damage, &/or kill your loved ones - survivors are typically subjected to gaslighting by healthcare professionals & told it's either ""unrelated"", ""anecdotal"", &/or ""sad, but necessary for the greater good"", though vaccine proponents throw around HIGHLY PUBLICIZED anecdotal propaganda pieces like those penned by that Jennifer White-Hibben shill & that pervert Roald Dahl as if they should automatically sway people to their views without question.

Those whose stories vaccine injury deniers refer to as ""anecdotal"" are people - not just numbers and collateral damage to be sacrificed & swept under the rug for someone else's notion of a ""greater good.""

No one has the right to demand someone else's child be lethally injected, regardless of who claims it serves the common interest.

20 Things I Wish Vaccine Junkies Would Admit
https://leviquackenboss.wordpress.com/2015/02/23/20-things-i-wish-vaccine-junkies-would-admit/

*Toxins, Informed Consent, & Vaccines

Always important to look into things & do your own research. Here's a place to start, but first a question...

Why are so many poisons pushed on us as safe?

I believe ""Autism"" - a deceptive umbrella term used to distract via misdirection - and myriad other modern day afflictions are exploding because we've been bombarded with all manner of genotoxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, endocrine disrupting chemicals, neurotoxic heavy metals, oncogenic pathogens, & assorted poisons for generations. Many are cumulative, & will pass onto our progeny.

*ABSENCE OF ACCOUNTABILITY 
http://goo.gl/qieL6v

Vaccine Related Videos, Documentaries, & Audio Clips
http://goo.gl/K0s7Aw

I find it ironic, that the pro-vaccine fanatics are looking to hold non-vaccinating people legally & financially responsible for the spread of diseases, when those who push vaccines (which can cause myriad issues including death, lifelong disability, autoimmune disorders, & circulating virulent strains of the very diseases they are supposed to protect against) have been unconstitutionally shielded from any accountability or liability for harms done to people by their dangerous products.

Vaccines will tell you right in the inserts that they have not been evaluated for carcinogenic (creates cancer) or mutagenic potential (damages DNA which can cause all sorts of issues including autoimmune disorders & various afflictions currently listed as genetic disorders), or potential to impair pregnancy. They will also list that it is not known whether they can cause fetal harm or affect reproduction capacity. (possibility of hurting growing babies, spontaneous abortions, &/or sterilization)

The lists of disturbing adverse events/reactions, possible side-effects, & even just the omissions where there is a conspicuous lack of research in areas that should not be neglected such as the capacity to give you cancer, damage your genes, harm your babies, or sterilize you speaks volumes - as does the fact that these companies & the governments who endorse them are known not so much for their integrity as their lack of it. 

Should you witness your child suffer a reaction, or even die, the healthcare community has been trained to misconstrue the situation, often dismissing the parents, in what can accurately be referred to as ""Medical Gaslighting"".

If vaccines are so safe, why do those who create & push them need special protections outside of our justice system which undermine people's constitutionally protected rights to hold them liable when they cause harm?

We need to start working to put an end to those legal immunities they enjoy, & start going after the people within our legal systems who are using their political platforms as a means of practicing medicine as they work to mandate medical procedures, removing our rights to bodily integrity & informed consent.

If you don't have the right to refuse, then you have no rights at all.

http://goo.gl/R2Vtwv

For those who assert that vaccines are safe...

PROVE that ANY ingredient in vaccines is SAFE, rather than poisonous when injected.

PROVE that vaccines have ever eradicated a disease, aside from junk science & correlation.

Don't forget that vaccines have been legally recognized as ""Unavoidably Unsafe"" & that their manufacturers are legally immune from being sued within the states for harms they may do.

Don't forget to compare each the FDA's & the EPA's listed acceptable ""safe limits"" of exposure to the various ingredients in vaccines - noting the differences between ingestion vs injection, with the actual amount within the vaccines themselves, to tally up the totals for the cumulative exposure of each, if following the CDC's recommended schedule.

Don't forget that not all ingredients will be listed on the vaccine insert. (Some are withheld as 'proprietary ingredients' or because amounts considered negligible.)

Don't forget that it's acknowledged, they can kill people. Ever wonder how many people die from vaccines a year? Who knows, because last I looked, for some reason -($$$)- much like circumcision they dance around listing it as a cause of death.

Just because something has been entrenched in dogma for decades, doesn't mean it has any inherent merit. Many diseases that were epidemic at the same time as so called ""vaccine preventable"" diseases, declined on their own - without any vaccinations for them being introduced. (Last I recall, the official story that the Earth was 'flat', was being told for a LOOOOOOONG time, too.)

How on earth did our species survive for so many thousands of years before we started using poisons, disease, & genital mutilation as substitutes for our natural immune systems?

We didn't all die. Hell, why bother having doctors wash their hands before surgery or delivering infants if bypassing the body's defenses & introducing pathogens via unnatural means is such a good idea?

Particularly in light of the necessity of health freedom, the skepticism, concern, & questions of so many, the rash of inexplicable ailments plaguing our younger generations:

Why is it not MANDATORY to report ANY acute adverse events/reactions at least within the first month after vaccinating, to be scrutinized & compared against the known effects of each ingredient in vaccines, & kept closely monitored, rather than a voluntary system that not only shields manufacturers, but strongly discourages healthcare practitioners from disclosure of information that goes against entrenched establishment's vaccine dogma?

I'd love to just be able to shut up, mind my own business, & do my own thing, but vaccine zealots are always actively working to remove our rights to decline.

For those who say, just keep your kids at home & homeschool - homeschooling has been under attack, as well.

Case in point - the German refugees who fled based on being persecuted for homeschooling - that Obama was going to send back to Germany, because ""homeschooling is not protected by the Constitution"". Go figure.

Doesn't seem like much of anything is safe, anymore.

I've had vaccines forced on me, & my children have had vaccines forced on them, over my objections.

Today's CDC recommended vaccine schedule pushes a MUCH greater number of vaccines today, than it did when we were kids.

Unless you have gotten ALL of those recommended vaccines complete with regular boosters, you aren't up to date, the efficacy of those old vaccines has ""expired"", and by pro-vaccine specs - you're every bit as much of a ""threat"" as an unvaccinated child.

If every adult you knew, started getting ""caught up"" on their boosters for all the recommended vaccines, you can bet, it'd start getting ~REAL~ noticeable.

Dr. Paul Offit is a vaccine proponent, who says babies can handle as much as 10k vaccines at once & be fine. Heard he later upped that amount, though haven't pursued further looking into that.

By that assertion, adults ~SHOULD~ be able to get an indeterminate amount of vaccines safely.

If you really trust it, then YOU & EVERYONE YOU KNOW SHOULD BE REGULARLY GETTING BOOSTERS FOR EVERYTHING YOU USED TO GET, AS WELL AS EVERYTHING CURRENTLY RECOMMENDED BY THE CDC SCHEDULE.

If you trust it, then encourage it among vaccine proponents & you'll start rapidly losing numbers to adverse events/reactions & the vaccine skeptics movement.

As for jokes about vaccines against anti-vaxxers, I bet big pharma would try to sell you one...

""New Anti-Conspiracy-Weirdo Vaccine. Completely nerfs one's capacity to question the official narrative."" (Lining up for lobotomies was once in vogue, too.)

In modern times, we aren't so barbaric. We prefer our lobotomies to be chemically induced.

************************************

You can not prove VACCINES saved ANY lives, and diseases that vaccine proponents claim to have eradicated, etc, were largely dying down due to:

*) natural cycle of seasonal illnesses
*) improved sanitation practices
*) access to clean water
*) improved nutrition & food storage

All of those are KNOWN to be highly relevant factors in the incidence of disease.

Any claim that vaccines have wiped out any disease is pure correlation, which ignored EVERY relevant factor besides vaccines that are far more likely to have contributed to an increased lifespan, including, but not limited to doctors FINALLY getting over the DOGMA that washing hands properly between visits to the morgue and the maternity ward was beneath them. (That made a major difference!)

Nutrition, access to clean water, sanitation, & number of people having to closely associate with each other are all highly relevant.

Interestingly, our nutrition & sanitation have been under assault via GMO monocrop industrial agriculture, factory farmed animals drugged with antibiotics rather than addressing institutionalized lack of sanitation, rampant industrial pollution, chemical contaminants, metal contaminants, organic contaminants, pasteurization &/or irradiation of everything, censorship of nutrient benefits via FDA, cracking down on urban farmers, crop sharing, etc .

We've also crammed so many people into close quarters within the city - we're practically begging for epidemics.

Our water has been actively bombarded with shit (both figuratively & literally) that would make your average, blissfully ignorant Joe, want to barf his f*cking soul out to realize what's been allowed & deliberately added into the water we drink & bathe in. (See blending & fracking.)

Our government has been known to employ tactics of war - including biological, chemical, & psychological warfare - on their own people. I see no reason to believe they haven't been proactively poisoning us, given what I've learned of their past behaviors, & comparing it with our current issues.

Fracking
http://scholar.google.com/scholar...

Isn't it amazing how scientists dependent on the current establishment for their livelihoods praise the correlation of diseases that dwindled due to some suspiciously convenient timing in the introduction of their vaccines & radical changes in diagnostics criteria, but cry, ""Correlation does not equal causation!"", when a kid becomes neurologically damaged, chronically ill, comes down with an autoimmune disease, is disabled, &/or  drops dead within close proximity of being injected with ingredients KNOWN to cause their various symptoms?

Oh, and, ""Correlation means nothing when it comes to improved nutrition, sanitation, & water as factors for the decline in those diseases"", either.

""Vaccines are our salvation. Praise them."" Dissent is heresy.

If you vaccinate you're allowing the injection of poison. Not ""at risk."" Straight up, poisoning.

Dose them up, hope for the best, & tell yourself it was ""for the greater good"" if it doesn't work out so well.

Very generous to volunteer their well-being for the greater good, but I don't think making a sacrifice for your ideals is so virtuous when the sacrifice is being forced on someone who can not/has not expressly given informed consent. http://goo.gl/WuPZPx

I would rather not sacrifice my children to the gods of entrenched fascist & scientific dogma.

***********************

It never ceases to amaze me seeing pro-vax fanatics who demand credible evidence, outright dismiss &/or attempt to discredit anything they're presented as they parrot the views & share the writings of shills, snopes, brazenly conflicted corrupt governmental agencies, medical & educational institutions that were philanthropically hijacked & molded by pharmaceutical interests a century ago, corporate propaganda, pro-vax celebrities, & magicians who make a living off of misdirection as if they were reliable sources.

Rather than having your opinions spoonfed to you by corporate (fascist) media & those pushing their ""$Â¢ienÂ¢e"" (dogmatic fascist propaganda & tobacco science), a government anyone with a functioning brain knows is corrupt to the core, & shills indoctrinated into a corrupt ""healthcare"" system with educational institutions that are irreconcilably enmeshed with & shaped by pharmaceutical companies Â­molding them to serve their interests, while actively working to nerf their capacity for critical thinking & objective reasoning - Â­ try actually listening to what each side of the argument has to say... not only because the lives of future generations depend on us, but because -Â­ as so many stabÂ­happy, poison pushing vaccine proponents love to say -Â­ because ""Science!"" 

Science is not blindly embracing dogmatic ideas as if they were written in stone & closing yourself off to information that doesn't suit the beliefs you were spoon fed. 

Science builds upon the foundation of historical knowledge as it evolves, is always questioning, taking in new information, & objectively weighing the merit of arguments presented by the various sides of an issue Â­- the killing of sacred cows rather than placing them on pedestals & worshiping them.

Science does not look to silence the skeptics & censorship is its enemy. 

It accepts that it has been mistaken many times during",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
its growth, & is humble enough to know it doesn't have all the answers - even that those it has could later be proven wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2)Every ingredient in vaccines is toxic when injected & can actually exponentially enhance each others toxicity - yet no testing is done prior to vaccination to protect those with allergies &/or mitochondrial disorders which are known to predispose an individual to severe, even lethal reactions. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1)Because you love your child & would never want to deliberately expose them to dangerous, possibly lethal, controversial procedures involving toxic substances pushed by those with conflicting interests, & no accountability in the event of injury or death occurring.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On Tuesday, suspected gang member Arvin Benson pleaded not guilty to gunning down Diaz in what police described as a racial killing.

Police say Benson, who is black, killed Diaz simply because he was Latino. 

The 33-year-old served as a youth minister at New Beginning Community Ministries Church where he worked with at-risk boys.

""I was in the streets, doing drugs. He came to my house, trying to help me,"" Raphael Gurrola said of Diaz. ""I followed him because of the way he looked, he looked happy. It made me want to be like him.""

Trump?™s ascendant bid for the GOP presidential nomination has included its uglier moments, such as the instance where his supporters kicked and hit a ?œBlack Lives Matter??protester during a campaign rally. As expected of any braggart and bully, Trump dismissed the incident and brushed it off by saying that maybe the protester ?œdeserved to get roughed up.??
The same thing is now happening to the GOP establishment as its base coalesces around a racist and xenophobic candidate it cannot stand or control, and who it knows cannot win the general election next year. Unlike the poor guy at the campaign rally, however, Grand Old Party might actually deserve this beat-down. After all, it created the right conditions, thanks to decades of xenophobic and racist politicking. ~Patrick

It is the way of the true American Conservative to mind their own business, care for their family, be a cheerful giver, and mind their own business. However, we have arrived at a critical moment where our go along, get along, mindset must change. We are quickly headed towards a slippery slope of no return. We must now confront and challenge the thought police, the suppressors of truth, and false narratives of moral equivalency. America is not bad. America is good. America is the most benevolent nation in the history of the world. It has freed more men from tyrannies oppressive boot, than all other nations combined. America has shown an incredible capacity to self correct when it has found itself on the wrong side of moral high ground. Tens of thousands died in the civil war for the oppressed black. Incredible that is never acknowledged in the current culture. It is now our solemn duty to speak the truth about America, or forever hold our peace; not of our own choosing, but the choosing of those we refused to confront while we still had opportunity.---Mark B",,16/06/2015 00:00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But according to the Serial Killer Information Center, started by Dr. Mike Aamodt, a professor of psychology at Radford University, that isn?™t entirely true.
His database has identified over 2,600 serial killers, which Aamodt defined as somebody who killed at least two people, in two separate instances, with a ?œcooling off??period in between.
Mass killers, however, typically kill a large number of people (usually four or more) in a single incident. Aamodt?™s definition differs slightly from the FBI?™s, which doesn?™t require a cooling off between killings.
Surprisingly, only 12.5% of US serial killers in Aamodt?™s database fit what most consider the typical profile ??a white male in his late mid- to late-20s. While 92.3% of US serial killers (94.4% internationally) are male, only 52.1% are white. Only 27% are in their mid- to late-20s.
From 1990 to 2010, the most recent year of data in the project, 52.1% of US serials killers were white, while 40.3% were black. The numbers don?™t change much internationally either. Worldwide, 56.2% are white, while 30% are black.

COLUMBUS, Minn. (KMSP) - He?™s armed, dangerous and took off with hundreds in cash from the Holiday gas station on Lake Drive in Columbus, Minn.

The suspect is so cavalier, he?™s now the star of Anoka County Sheriff?™s first surveillance footage reveal shared exclusively on social media.

?œHe had the gun leveled at both clerks and almost immediately took a real aggressive, hostile stance towards them,??Anoka County Sheriff?™s Commander Paul Sommer told FOX 9.

?œHe?™s just one sympathetic response away from pulling that trigger and committing murder,??nodded Sommer.

The clerks wasted no time. Just as quickly as the suspect stormed in he took off with drawers of cash.

?œNo vehicle was seen. The suspect simply entered on foot and left on foot,??Sommer informed.

On Friday morning, the Anoka County Sheriff?™s Commander posted the surveillance footage to Facebook and Twitter. This is the first time they?™ve shared surveillance video exclusively on social media.

Key about this decision? The video is edited to point out distinct identifiers. The suspect wore a two-toned snapback hat, a bandana, an h-shaped belt buckle, bracelet, black shoes and no apparent socks.

What more can be said other than that Democrats AND their Republican enablers like Boehner and Paul RINOcerous have wrecked America. This is their aim, to create a class of stupid ignorant behind welfare leeches who are good for nothing but voting once every four years for a change in their slave masters. And all of this while THEIR brats go to schools like Sidwell?™s and other very expensive prep schools and then off to the finest colleges that Mommy and Daddy can pay for. And who going into the services? The children of we the disenfranchised. The vermin in The District of Corruption work for themselves and don?™t give a flying hoot about the country and THAT makes them traitors to us, the Country,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite doubts in some quarters about the authenticity of his claims, Professor Maduike Ezeibe of Michael Okpara University of Agriculture Umudike (MOUAU), Abia State, has insisted that his recent therapy for the dreaded HIV and AIDS is real and effective.
The discovery of the therapy, Ezeibe said, was a major scientific breakthrough in the search for a cure to the global pandemic.
He said after 19 years of hard work, he was able to discover the therapy and his research was eventually published in the British Journal of Medicine & Medical Research.
The Professor of Veterinary Medicine, who obtained his first degree in same discipline at the University of Nigeria Nsukka in 1986, Masters in Ruminant Medicine, and doctorate degree in Canine Medicine all in UNN, said he moved to MOUAU on leave of absence.
Speaking with Southern City News in his office, he said his research into the therapy known as ?˜Antivirt??(Anti-Viral Therapy), dated back to 1994 when he took the challenge to be part of the global solution to the HIV/AIDS scourge ravaging humanity.
Ezeibe said his work had been published by the American-based medical journal known as The Health.
He said he decided to publish his research work on the therapy so as to prove anyone who would doubt that a black man could develop HIV/AIDS cure, wrong.
He boasted that the experiment remained authentic and verifiable in any part of the world.

The deputy sheriff was gunned down more than 1,000 miles from Missy Rumble?™s Blaine doorstep.

Yet the graphic news accounts of the fatal ambush-style shooting while Texan Darren Goforth was pumping gas in August shook Rumble to action.

?œI was watching the news and saw police officers being killed just for doing their jobs,??said Rumble, the daughter of a retired Coon Rapids police officer.

Rumble is now the force behind the Police Lives Matter concert and rally planned in Coon Rapids on Friday, Oct. 23. More than 650 people have already indicated they will attend on the event?™s Facebook page.

Anoka County?™s highest-ranking law enforcement officer, Sheriff James Stuart, has thrown his support behind the free event. He will address the crowd at Coon Rapids American Legion Post 334.

?œThey had reached out that they wanted to do an event in Coon Rapids in light of the war being waged against law enforcement,??Stuart said. ?œWe need to get away from the propaganda. We need to look at the real statistics. It?™s amazing how good the outcomes can be when we sit down and talk to each other.??
The Coon Rapids event?™s name is a play on the Black Lives Matter movement that emerged in 2013 to protest police brutality against black Americans.

Nationwide, some Black Lives Matter supporters have criticized the refrain ?œAll Lives Matter??and other variations on their slogan, arguing that it is culturally tone-deaf and ignores decades of institutional racism and police brutality.


Lena K. Gardner, an organizer with Black Lives Matter Minneapolis, said she did not know about the Police Lives Matter rally and declined to comment.

Rumble also declined to express an opinion on the Black Lives Matter rallies taking place in the Twin Cities and in cities across the country.

?œI don?™t know that group well enough to have any thoughts on them,??said Rumble, an administrative assistant. ?œI know I?™d rather show support than protest.??
She said grass-roots support for the event has been overwhelming. Three bands will perform. There will be a silent auction and donations collected for the Officer Down Memorial Page, a charity honoring fallen officers.

Sheriff Stuart said that in his remarks, he?™d advise all groups to dump divisive slogans and focus on fostering police-community relations.

?œThe message we keep hearing is ?˜black lives matter??or ?˜blue lives matter.??Every time we attach a color to it, it is so divisive,??Stuart said.

?œWe embrace the fact that we serve and protect everyone.??
Duane Kropuenske, a volunteer facilitator at the American Legion post, said organizers expect an overflow crowd.

?œWe have our entire staff booked to work, plus 30 volunteers,??he said.

Kropuenske said a positive police event will reflect what many in the community feel.

?œI don?™t think this is a negative effort to criticize any other group,??he said. ?œIt?™s strictly a positive one to compliment law enforcement.??
In the north metro, many officers coach youth sports and volunteer, Kropuenske said.

?œOur entire board feels we owe something to law enforcement in the area,??he said.

?œIt?™s a dangerous job, and most of the time a thankless job. ??We thought it was a great opportunity to show our support.??http://www.startribune.com/police-lives-matter-rally-in-coon-rapids-aims-to-show-support-for-officers/330791481/",Organizers expect hundreds at event supporting law enforcement officers.,08/10/2015 00:00,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1.81135E+11,Law Enforcement Today,181135410243_10157057975455244,"Police union chief blasts 'disrespect' for cops, 'anti-police correctness'","Police union chief blasts 'disrespect' for cops, 'anti-police correctness'

The Chicago police union president decried an unprecedented ""level of disrespect"" faced by officers on the street and called for more vocal public support of police, saying, ""There's a deafening silence out there right now.""

In a speech Tuesday to the City Club of Chicago, Dean Angelo Sr. complained that officers' hands are being tied by ""anti-police correctness"" and warned that as a byproduct Chicago is headed back to the days of 900 homicides a year. He said homicides, which totaled 473 in 2015, will probably reach 700 this year.

Angelo repeatedly rebuked the news media for fanning the discontent against Chicago police, suggesting they are doing it to sell newspapers and boost ratings. Though he never specifically referred to the infamous Laquan McDonald shooting video, he was especially critical of news operations for replaying videos of alleged misconduct involving officers ""as if it's a Super Bowl-winning touchdown.""

""It's played over and over and over again until it's embedded in the audience's mind,"" Angelo told about 200 civic leaders at the luncheon. ""If it's not edited before it gets to the media, they edit it just enough to give somebody that oh-my-gosh moment.""

Angelo's public appeal comes as the Police Department faces an unprecedented crisis ??a U.S. Justice Department probe amid the fallout over the video of McDonald being shot 16 times, a dispirited rank-and-file and violence surging at levels not seen since the late 1990s.

The Fraternal Order of Police president tried to walk a fine line, saying that police continue to do their jobs effectively, taking guns off the streets and making thousands of narcotics arrests, but at the same time he spoke of street stops plummeting by more than 150,000 so far this year. He denied a so-called ""Ferguson effect"" has led to the slowdown, instead blaming the more extensive paperwork that officers must fill out this year for every stop because of racial-profiling concerns. But he also acknowledged that many officers feel ""no one has their backs.""

Police mood appears to hit a low amid fallout from Laquan McDonald video
Police mood appears to hit a low amid fallout from Laquan McDonald video
""We have an Orlando every month in Chicago, and no one seems to raise an eyebrow,"" he said in reference to the mass shooting in Florida earlier this month that took 49 lives. ""But catch a policeman hitting somebody on a video ??oh, my God!""

Police nationwide and especially in Chicago are facing ""a level of disrespect"" that Angelo said now-retired officers had never encountered even during the 1968 Democratic convention or the riots after the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.

""In some areas of our city, nearly every contact with the public is met with a level of confrontation,"" he said. People are taking smartphone videos of officers ""hoping for a payday,"" he said. ""And officers are regularly baited and literally, literally called every name in the book just to get a rise out of them, just to get a reaction.""

Police union chief: Task force had 'built-in bias' before report
Police union chief: Task force had 'built-in bias' before report
Angelo said he can't wait for the city to release unedited videos from officers' body cameras ""so you get to see what they see and what they deal with.""

He complained that ""everybody and their sister"" wants to make changes in policing and called it ""a dangerous time"" if the views of those ""who have never strapped a weapon on"" are given credibility.

He also criticized the City Council and the Illinois General Assembly for legislating ""from on high"" and not taking input from ""real police.""

Angelo said the ""perception"" among many police officers is that nobody has their backs, ""that they've become a second-class citizen.""

""Perceptions are real, and this is how they feel,"" he said.

Angelo also said officers believe they'll be punished for ""the least type of confrontation or physical contact"" as part of ""this new anti-police correctness"" era.

Angelo said the FOP sometimes feels alone in speaking out for police, and he again singled out the media for criticism.

""We've got friends in the media, but it doesn't sell. We've got friends at newspapers, but it doesn't sell newspapers,"" he said.

Angelo spoke of how poverty, drug activity and violence have gone hand in hand for generations as he displayed slides of abandoned buildings and empty lots on the West Side.

""You can't police your way out of this, but you look to police to deal with the fallout,"" he said.

Angelo also tried to put a positive light on the number of people shot by Chicago police officers over a recent eight-year period ??404 ??suggesting it could have been far worse given that during that same period police arrested 3,740 people armed with guns, he said.

He said a statistic that goes unnoticed is the more than 13,000 officers who have been battered on the job over that same eight-year period.

He spoke of an El Salvadoran cartoonist whose work the FOP recently ran in its monthly magazine. The country had attempted to make a truce with the criminal element ??only to have ""a bull's-eye"" placed on police and the bad guys allowed to run free, Angelo said.

One cartoon showed a blindfolded Lady Justice patting the head of ""a little gangbanger"" who's armed with a gun while a police officer is being led off to jail, Angelo said. ""The world upside down,"" the cartoon said in Spanish, a theme Angelo repeated during his remarks.

""We're right here right now"" in Chicago, he said.

Angelo strongly denied officers are lying down on the job in frustration or anger over the increased scrutiny.

""No one is backing off calls for service,"" he said. ""No one is not taking police action when it is required.""

But he said officers have been handcuffed in their ability to get the job done.

""We've limited the officers' ability to put people on the wall (as) we called it when I was"" in the gang crimes unit, the 36-year department veteran said.

He then launched into criticism of the laborious paperwork for every street stop that is slowing down officers' work on the street ??and affecting the rise in violence in Chicago so far this year.

A state law mandated the change after an analysis of the department's own data by the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois showed that Chicago police stopped African-Americans at a disproportionately higher rate than Hispanics and whites, especially in predominantly white neighborhoods.

Angelo said state legislators ignored his warnings against saddling officers with the extensive paperwork, saying he predicted at the time a return to 900 murders a year.

""We've got to re-examine this,"" he said. ""If you don't take the corner back or if you give the corner back, you lose the corner, you lose the block, you lose the community and we're at 900 (homicides).""

After his speech, Angelo fielded several questions from the audience. He said he wished the media realized that police officers are human.

""We take care of sick parents. We go to service on the weekends. We coach Little League. We've got soccer moms, hockey dads. We have bills. We have mortgages. We have tuitions, and most of us have several jobs.""

 Reporters are renowned for swapping war stories, but they came to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to tell horror stories about trying to use Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, requests to get the truth from the federal government.
Testifying before the House Oversight Committee, five-time Emmy award-winning investigative reporter Sharyl Attkisson described receiving FOIAs with everything redacted (blacked out) but the address line.
She said it took the Defense Department 10 years to comply with one FOIA, in violation of the 20 days prescribed by law. The reporter said the Centers for Disease Control once told her it was too busy dealing with Ebola to even bother complying with her FOIA.
Attkisson testified federal bureaucrats have told her they don?™t face repercussions for withholding information, but they would face ?œconsequences??for releasing information.
Investigative reporter Leah Goodman of Newsweek said reporters with whom she had spoken feared they would be the ones facing consequences if they testified before the committee.
She said there were no Washington-based editors or reporters from major publications on the panel testifying before the committee because they were afraid it would have a ?œchilling effect??on their relations with the federal departments they cover.
Goodman said that was also the reason no one had done a major story on the problems with government agencies stonewalling FOIA requests.
Former Associated Press reporter Terry Anderson, who was kidnapped in 1985 and held hostage by Hezbollah for seven years in Lebanon, said he was told by the federal government he couldn?™t FOIA information on his kidnappers because it would violate their privacy rights.
Anderson said he was told he could get the information if his kidnappers signed a notarized release, but said he was not interested in reuniting with them.
Anderson also described a four-year battle with 13 federal agencies, each with their own standards and processes, over just one FOIA.
Investigative reporter Jason Leopold of Vice News said fewer than 1 percent of his thousands of FOIA requests have been processed within the required 20-day limit.
He said the Defense Department recently sent him 150 pages that were completely redacted and so useless he was trying to figure out how to turn them into an art display.
Goodman likened dealing with a federal agency to coping with an off-shore call center. She said there was truth to the joke, ?œIf you want to know what you?™ll be writing about in three years, file a FOIA.??

HIALEAH, Fla. - A South Florida man was arrested Thursday morning after he dismembered a human body and dumped the remains near train tracks in Hialeah, authorities said.

The remains were found Wednesday night in the area west of Palm Avenue and 21st Street.

According to an arrest report, numerous body parts were found scattered at the scene in black garbage bags, including hands, a foot, a head and partial limbs.

Hialeah police said a collision with a train caused the bags to break and the remains to scatter around the tracks.

Police said surveillance video from a nearby business shows the suspect, William Martinez, 40, walking from an apartment complex toward the tracks on Monday and Tuesday.

He was seen Tuesday throwing an object onto the tracks, police said.

According to the report, detectives knocked on the door to the apartment where Martinez lives with his mother and smelled a strong odor that appeared to be coming from a decomposing body. They said they also saw a mop and cleaning materials on the floor.

Detectives said they observed a BBQ with a black cover on it that smelled like a decomposing body was inside.

Martinez's mother told detectives that her son admitted to her that he killed the victim inside the bedroom of the home, dismembered his body, and stored his body parts inside her BBQ and green garbage tank.

He also told her that he dumped body parts on the train tracks, detectives said.

Police found part of the body inside the garbage tank.

Authorities said Martinez knew the victim and believe that the killing was the result of an argument between the two.

The victim's identity will not be released until police can notify relatives.

They said it's unclear how Martinez killed the victim.

Martinez faces charges of second-degree murder and abuse of a corpse.

This resulted in thousands of African American and Hispanic customers paying over $200 more on auto loans over the course of the loan than White customers.

The discrepancy was NOT related to how credit worthy the Black and Latino customers were, and dealers were reportedly allowed to pocket the additional interest as compensation.

They were so stupid that they wanted Sara Palin in as the vice president so they voted for Obama! Some being interviewed said they voted for Obama for the free money. I wonder how that is working out!

The point is this; many people are stupid. They are so oblivious to what is going on in our country that they just vote for the entitlements, or the promise of ""free money"" that they are never going to get anyway. They vote blindly without knowing the issues or what the parties stand for. Many people are registered in a party because that is the party that their parents were registered with. Most black people are registered in the Democratic Party because they are looking for the entitlements. Most are inner city people that just fall for what ever they are told. They don't listen to debates or current events. Most voted for Obama for the free money and to get a black man in the office. There should be a test prior to being able to vote. You should have to be able to list the candidates that are running, tell about what they believe in, you should have to list what your beliefs are and then be registered in the party that is closest to your beliefs.

Christopher Driscoll teaches religious studies at Lehigh University. He claims consulting with hip-hop artist Asheru, as well as Kashi Johnson who is another Lehigh associate professor, to create the brilliant list below reported by Campus Reform.
1. #AllLivesMatter won?™t matter until #BlackLivesMatter. This commandment is a litmus test and the greatest commandment.
2. Always remember that white privilege is real, even if you do not understand it. Use it to convince other people that black lives, including black women?™s lives, matter. Show up for protests, write letters to representatives, and start discussions with other white people about black lives mattering.
3. Always remember that ignorance is real, and is a product of privilege. Treat the ignorant with compassion, but hold them accountable.
4. Never think that the critique does not apply to you. Just because you were at Barack?™s inauguration and your dad was a freedom rider, or because you are the head of your local chapter of GLADD, that does not mean you do not have more work to do on yourself, your family, and your community.
5. Always remember that it is never a question of if violence, but whose violence are you going to defend. Unjust state-sanctioned and racist violence, or justified resistance; the choice is yours, the choice is ours.
6. Never tolerate racism from your friends or family. Whether it is coming from your eighteen-year-old friend, your thirty-one-year-old cousin, or your eighty-year-old grandmother, confront it always. Confronting racism does not mean you will lose your friend or family. It means you will help to make them act and think in less racist ways.
7. You cannot love cultural products without also loving the people who make those products. If you like black art or athletics, that appreciation is an entryway into recognizing that black lives matter.
8. Never quote black leaders like Dr. King in order to criticize protesters and activists.
9. Always embrace uncertainty. Life is uncertain; death is certain. Uncertainty promotes life; certainty produces death and destruction.
10. Never put white fragility ahead of justice. If you are more concerned to argue that you ?œaren?™t racist??than you are with racism or with people dying, you?™re priorities are skewed. Do you want justice or comfort?
It?™s disheartening to see allegedly well educated men fueling further racism in our country. Just the mere fact that their list is dubbed the ?œTen Cracka Commandments,??is completely discrediting before you even read the first one.

July, 2016
Over the last three years there has been growing concern in the public discourse about the use of force, especially lethal force, by the police in the United States. This concern spawned the creation
of the Black Lives Matter organization and motivated President Obama to organize a commission on policing in the 21st century. Concerns over several highly publicized and politicized deaths of
African-American men by police use of force have produced numerous public protests in almost every city, town, and university in the nation. Most of these protests have been peaceful, but many
have not, especially the protest in Dallas on July 7 that resulted in eleven officers being shot, five of them fatally. This was followed on July 17 by the ambush of officers in Baton Rouge, with 6 officers shot, 3 of them fatally. In the public discussion around the topic of police use of force, many disturbing claims have been
made by civil rights groups, the news media, and even government leaders. However, as President Obama stated in his October 27, 2015 address to the International Association of Chiefs of Police,
?œtoo often law enforcement gets scapegoated for broader failures of our society.?? The purpose of this report, therefore, is to fact check these various claims and, with the aid of scientific research
and other credible sources, try to determine if these claims are indeed true. The reader is encouraged to access and explore the many references cited in this report so that the reader can
assess the facts and make up his or her own mind.

An Atlanta-area woman who called for black people to ?œrise up and shoot every white cop??apologized for her Facebook post Friday.

Prosecutors charged Ebony Dickens with terroristic threats and inciting a riot after they said she wrote, ?œI condone black on white killings. Hell they condone crimes against us,??and ?œdeath to all white cops nationwide??under her Facebook name Tiffany Milan last April.

Yet they dropped the rap in exchange for her offering of remorse while surrounded by law enforcement officials at a news conference Friday, WSB-TV reported.

Ebony Dickens, 34, apologized on Friday to Atlanta-area law enforcement officials after they said she wrote a Facebook post last year calling on black people to kill all white police officers.
?œIt was not meant that way. I would never advocate for anybody else to be harmed by anyone. I wouldn?™t push that upon my worst enemy. It?™s not the person that I am,??said Dickens, 34, a small business owner with a master's degree in criminal justice. ?œMy apology is genuine and sincere because I know for a fact that I do not want anyone's lives taken, anyone being harmed by something that I put on Facebook.??
Dickens, who is African-American, said she meant the post as satire but understands why she was arrested after East Point police said she predicted that she ?œmight kill at least fifteen tomorrow.??She wanted to write something preposterous in hopes of starting a conversation during protests and riots in Baltimore after the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray, she said.

?œI?™m apologetic because I would?™ve been devastated if something had happened to an officer at the time that this happened,??Dickens said. ?œThat would?™ve killed me because I didn?™t think about that.??
DeKalb County Public Safety Director Dr. Cedric Alexander and Atlanta Police Union President Ken Allen also spoke Friday at Jackson Memorial Baptist Church, which often hosts funerals for officers killed in the line of duty.

Dickens was later charged with terroristic threats and inciting a riot.
?œWhen you put something that devastating and life threatening out, it could end in tragedy at any given time,??Allen said. ?œWhat she posted could have. It didn't happen here, luckily.??http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/georgia-woman-called-death-white-cops-apologizes-article-1.2628073?cid=bitly",An Atlanta-area woman who called for black people to ?œrise up and shoot every white cop??apologized for her Facebook post Friday.,07/05/2016 00:00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

prominent figures in Democratic Party politics in the last two decades. She is the wife of a popular two-term ex-president, a former New York senator and a former secretary of state.  She is supremely well-financed, possessed of unparalleled networks in politics, media and business, and boasts an enormous number of endorsements. She is as skilled and experienced as anyone on the presidential campaign trail could be. As such, plain and simple, Hillary Clinton should have performed like the prohibitive favorite she is supposed to be.

But that is not what happened. She effectively lost to a 74-year-old Vermont senator with no prior national profile; who had openly declared himself a socialist; who had no super PAC funding or Wall Street money behind him; and who couldn?™t call on a veritable Maginot line of endorsements and cronies and ambitious toadies to grease his path.  

So, yes, I say Hillary Clinton lost. This was a classic David vs. Goliath match and, as in the Bible, David with his simple slingshot and rock bested the bigger, better-equipped adversary.

Democrats should quickly have some serious conversation about Clinton?™s durable weaknesses. First and foremost, she has never been able to excite the core Democratic base. She was clearly out of step with that base in 2008, a disparity that allowed Barack Obama to snatch the nomination and ultimately the presidency from her grasp eight years ago. Despite the clarity of that lesson, she seems once again to be seriously disconnected from a huge faction of Democratic voters. Just as a message of ?œchange??beat ?œcompetence??in 2008, one has to really worry that ?œrevolution??is going to have more appeal and staying power on the campaign trail than ?œexperience.??
Moreover, the Clintons, and now I mean Hillary and Bill, have worked so hard to remain on center stage for so long?”zigging and zagging and morphing and message-spinning with the best of them?”that it is hard for Hillary Clinton to credibly claim to have some major, clear principles and positions for which she has always stood. Bill Clinton?™s years in office involved too many deeply regrettable compromises with the Republican right wing. Her own time on the campaign trail has been, until after Obama?™s final State of the Union address two weeks ago, astonishingly devoid of a full-throated defense of the accomplishments of the Obama years (thereby implicitly ceding space to the toxic Republican critique of the last eight years of Democratic leadership).

Hence, as she now backpedals, starts to actually use Obama?™s name in speeches and tries linking herself to policy accomplishments that Democrats appreciate?”such as the economic bailout, saving the auto industry and Obamacare?”it feels as if Hillary Clinton is, at best, a little desperate and, at worst, craven, opportunistic and all-too-plainly insincere in the face of the Bernie Sanders challenge.

One great irony of the moment at this point is that Clinton is now banking on black people to save her in the South Carolina primary, shortly after her likely looming loss to Sanders in New Hampshire. This though some African-American voices, such as legal scholar and public intellectual Michelle Alexander, with increasingly pointed fervor, are raising tough questions about whether the Clintons, Hillary or Bill, are deserving of black support. There is every reason to believe there will be some tough questions raised in the weeks ahead on whether Hillary Clinton is really the candidate for black America. Fair enough. Sensible voters should raise tough questions about her record, her commitments, and frankly, about her viability given the loss in Iowa.

And this is where the case of Jeb Bush becomes relevant. If one thing is clear this political season it is that Americans on both sides of the political aisle, Democrat and Republican, are weary and distrustful of the old political messages and faces. There is a real deep exhaustion with all of the usual suspects, including Hillary Clinton.

On the Republican side, viable candidates closely attuned to the passions of the party base stepped forward to run, like Ted Cruz, and, especially, a wealthy, charismatic applecart-upsetting political newcomer like Donald Trump. Consequently, the ranks of establishment politicians were virtually all swept into irrelevance, including John Kasich and Chris Christie, not to mention Lindsay Graham. This was particularly true of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who, like Hillary Clinton, began 2015 as the presumptive nominee of his party. Despite the name recognition, despite the money and despite the legacy, he did no better than sixth place in Iowa and pulled only single-digit levels of support.

Imagine a hypothetical then: 

What if a Democrat more closely attuned to the passions of the party-base voters had stepped forward early in 2015, like Elizabeth Warren? 

Or what if there were a wealthy, charismatic applecart-upsetting political newcomer out there among Democrats? 

Does anyone really think Hillary Clinton?™s fate would be appreciably different in this scenario from that of Jeb Bush in the current political climate? I have very serious doubts.

But as subsequent violence occur in that city, they?™re being exposed as hypocrites, pure and simple.
Since the riots, Baltimore has become an urban hellhole. Police, having been blamed by individuals such as Al Sharpton, as well as civic leaders and the community itself for the riots, have backed away from aggressive law enforcement.
Not surprisingly, Baltimore?™s murder rate has increased by 600%.
On Sunday, local media reported on just one murder, but it was horrific.
Arnesha Bowers, age 16, thought Adonay Dixon, 23, and John Childs, 20, were her friends. On Saturday night, they attended a party together. It was there that Dixon and Childs made plans to rob Bowers??supposedly rich grandmother, with whom Bowers lived.
Dixon and Childs decided to burglarize the grandmother?™s apartment early Sunday morning when the grandmother would be working at a local hospital and only Bowers would be home. They decided that if Bowers awoke during their burglary, they could restrain her in a chokehold.
But that?™s not how the robbery went down.
Dixon and Childs entered the apartment through a basement window and got $40, an iPad and a laptop computer. When Bowers awoke, they sexually assaulted her, strangled her with an electric cord and set her body on fire, along with the rest of the apartment.
By Wednesday, Dixon and Childs were in police custody. Both were gang members and had criminal records (H/T Gateway Pundit).
There was no subsequent riot or wanton property destruction in the Baltimore streets as there was after Freddie Gray?™s death from injuries allegedly sustained while in police custody.

Detectives in California said Tuesday they are looking for three persons of interest in the killing of a man found shot on a hiking trail with his wounded dog attached to his hand by a leash.

Marin County sheriff?™s investigators released surveillance video that shows two of the three people they want to question in connection with the shooting of Steve Carter, 67. The footage, taken from a convenience store in Fairfax near the trail where the body was found, shows a long-haired man wearing a black hat and a woman with dirty-blond hair wearing dark clothing.

Carter?™s body was found Monday along the trail 20 miles north of San Francisco, the Marin County Sheriff?™s Department said. He was still holding onto the leash of a Doberman Pinscher, believed to be his dog, Lt. Doug Pittman said. The dog survived its injuries and was turned over to the Marin Humane Society, he said.

Carter's brother, Michael Carter, told the San Francisco Chronicle: ""I've heard that he was murdered, but I haven't heard anything other than that.""

Carter said that he knew of no one who disliked his brother. ""I can't imagine that it's anything other than a random thing. All of it seems very random and unbelievable. Nothing makes any sense,"" he said.

The Chronicle reports the motive for the killing remains a mystery as law enforcement officials searched for clues behind the murder. The killer or killers are believed to have fled the scene in Carter?™s 2003 Volkswagen Jetta station wagon.

Anyone who spots the car should treat the occupants as armed and dangerous, Pittman said.

Carter and his wife Lokita founded the Ecstatic Living Institute based in Middletown, Calif. He was a Tantra teacher and participated in numerous training sessions across the country, in Canada and Costa Rica. The couple released DVDs on Tantric massage, yoga for lovers and medication. They also taught classes at Harvin Hot Springs, a clothing-optional retreat in the Middletown mountains that burned down last month in Lake County?™s devastating wildfire, according to the newspaper.

Logan Rose, director of the Ecstatic Living Institute, said the Carters recently led retreats for couples in Costa Rica and had come to Marin County so Lokita could undergo treatment for breast cancer.

""It has been a very traumatic season for us with Lokita's cancer, then the Valley Fire that destroyed our beloved Harbin Hot Springs where we offered the majority of our workshops,"" Rose said. ""This is the most devastating blow. We are heartbroken.""

Pittman said sheriff?™s deputies had checked on a report of gunfire about 45 minutes before the body was discovered. However, the report took officers to a nearby canyon and they didn?™t see anything.

Ben Tedder told the Chronicle he was questioned by police as he was hiking Monday. He told the newspaper he had a feeling something bad had happened.

?œTo hear that it could?™ve just been random is really scary,??he said. ?œKids go up there to tag or do graffiti in the tunnel up there, but nothing like this. Stuff like this doesn?™t happen around here.?http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/10/07/3-people-sought-for-questioning-in-california-hiking-trail-killing/?intcmp=hplnws",Detectives said Tuesday they are looking for three persons of interest in the killing of a man found shot to death on a Northern California hiking trail with his wounded dog attached to his hand by a leash.,07/10/2015 00:00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Fourteen years later and do you even believe it? Did we actually live it? Are we still living it? And how improbable is that?

Fourteen years of wars, interventions, assassinations, torture, kidnappings, black sites, the growth of the American national security state to monumental proportions, and the spread of Islamic extremism across much of the Greater Middle East and Africa. Fourteen years of astronomical expense, bombing campaigns galore, and a military-first foreign policy of repeated defeats, disappointments, and disasters. Fourteen years of a culture of fear in America, of endless alarms and warnings, as well as dire predictions of terrorist attacks. Fourteen years of the burial of American democracy (or rather its recreation as a billionaire?™s playground and a source of spectacle and entertainment but not governance). Fourteen years of the spread of secrecy, the classification of every document in sight, the fierce prosecution of whistleblowers, and a faith-based urge to keep Americans ?œsecure??by leaving them in the dark about what their government is doing. Fourteen years of the demobilization of the citizenry. Fourteen years of the rise of the warrior corporation, the transformation of war and intelligence gathering into profit-making activities, and the flocking of countless private contractors to the Pentagon, the NSA, the CIA, and too many other parts of the national security state to keep track of. Fourteen years of our wars coming home in the form of PTSD, the militarization of the police, and the spread of war-zone technology like drones and stingrays to the 'homeland.' Fourteen years of that un-American word 'homeland.'""

2.30538E+14,TomDispatch,230537773698519_1024865260932429,How This Became the Era of the Gunman - FPIF,"Here's my must-read essay of the month: John Feffer at Foreign Policy in Focus on how the iconic figure of our era has become the gunman, how a sense of war has come to America (all evidence to the contrary), and what this means for all of us.  Here's just part of the beginning section of the piece, but read it all!  Tom 

""Every era has its representative figure. The Neolithic era had the Farmer. The avatar of the Middle Ages was the Monk, bent over an illuminated manuscript. For the period before and after 1492, the Explorer captured the global imagination. During the Industrial Revolution, the Worker embodied the age of manufacturing.

""And now we have the Gunman.

""The Gunman is everywhere. He is a soldier. He is a policeman. He might be a right-wing extremist or a caliphate-inspired jihadi. He might be a survivalist atop a well-stocked bunker or a settler in occupied territory. He might be a maniac with no motivation other than mayhem. Or he might just be the middle-class dad next door who wants to protect his family. But he?™s usually a guy. Reports of a surge in U.S. women owning guns are largely anecdotal: Gunmen still outnumber gunwomen three to one.

""Shortly after the Orlando shootings, I was driving to a neighborhood Chinese restaurant with my wife?™s high school friend when I made a passing comment about the need to ban assault rifles. To my surprise, this otherwise liberal fellow begged to differ. Then he pointed out that he had three guns in the back of his MINI Cooper. Everyone is coming out of the closet these days, so why not gunmen?

""Guys with guns dominate the headlines. Young armed men are dispensing death in public places in service of any number of philosophies (racism, homophobia, the Islamic State, misanthropy). Meanwhile, the American police force has been conducting a veritable war against African-American men: 248 black men died last year at the hands of the police, 36 of them unarmed. Also last year, 42 police officers died by gunfire, a 14 percent decline over the previous year. This year, however, the numbers are rising. Including last week?™s shooting in Dallas, 26 police have been shot and killed in 2016. Overall, there were 372 mass shootings in the United States in 2015, and an astonishing 13,286 people died by gunshot.

""In this war on the American streets, it can be difficult to know who is on what side. In Dallas last week, when Micah Johnson killed five cops, he wasn?™t the only civilian with a gun in the vicinity. According to the Dallas mayor, more than 20 men in camouflage gear with rifles started to scatter when Johnson opened fire. Texas, after all, is an open-carry state.

""Instead of implementing gun control measures in the wake of Dallas and Orlando and all the other recent outbreaks of firearm violence, Congress has deadlocked on the mildest of reforms. Gun sales, meanwhile, are up.

""The number of households possessing guns has actually declined to around one in three, but not the overall number of guns in circulation. The average gun owner now possesses eight guns, twice as many as 20 years ago. The United States ranks number one in the world in per capita gun ownership: an astounding 112 guns per 100 residents. The next closest is Serbia at 75 (engulfed by war in the 1990s), followed by Yemen at 54 (engulfed by war today).

""Guns have become the new smartphone: an indispensable accessory for the modern age. I fear that one day a pop-up window will appear in my browser advertising the new iFirearm (iGun is already taken).""

LOS ANGELES ??Mona Shafer Edwards stepped through the doors of a downtown Los Angeles courtroom, striding past the bailiff, the defense attorney and prosecutors to a seat in the jury box.

She removed a Ziploc bag bulging with pens and markers from her Gucci purse and propped a sketch pad on her lap.

""You made me look really old,"" Judge Ronald S. Coen deadpanned from the bench. ""But you got the cleft chin right.""

""I'm sorry,"" Edwards said, laughing. ""I'll do better.""

Her pen darted over the page as Marion ""Suge"" Knight, a former rap mogul who now faces a murder charge, shuffled into the room. Bold strokes traced his scowl and handcuffed hands, the slouch of a detective on the witness stand, the dent in the judge's chin.

The courtrooms of Los Angeles are where the dramas of L.A.'s rich and famous play out, and for three decades Edwards has been there for some of the wildest. Pens and markers in hand ??she never uses pencil, and she never erases ??Edwards has captured the emptiness in the eyes of ""Night Stalker"" Richard Ramirez, the unsmiling face of O.J. Simpson and the ever-changing features of Michael Jackson.

She is among the few remaining sketch artists working today, fusing journalism and art to illustrate the theatrics and emotion of the courtroom. It is a skill that has managed to survive the introduction of photography and video, finding a home in courtrooms where those images are banned, or with judges weary of the distraction that the news media can bring.

As the Knight hearing ended, Edwards dashed outside to put the finishing touches on the sketches. Knight's jailhouse scrubs bloomed orange with a smear of marker, and each was finished with ""Mona"" signed in black.

As Knight's attorney held an impromptu news conference, Edwards taped the sketches onto a wall and the cameramen whose stations had paid for the images soon lined up single file, taking turns shooting close-ups as Edwards shooed away non-paying onlookers hoping to sneak a cellphone photo.

Knight's lawyer, Matthew Fletcher, wandered over for a look at himself.

""Oh, man,"" he said, rubbing the bald head depicted in the sketch.

?”â€”â€?
The sketches that flashed across the 10 o'clock news caught Edwards' eye ??for their lack of movement, artistry and flair.

""They were awful, just awful,"" she said. ""I told my husband, 'That's what I want to do. I can do that.'""

Edwards had been working for years as a fashion illustrator, hired by design houses and department stores and teaching at colleges around Los Angeles. She saw that her skills in fashion could translate to the courtroom.

She went to one station and showed the art director her illustrations. ""He told me 'You should stick with fashion,'"" Edwards said.

Next was KNBC, which gave her a shot, sending her to the soon-to-be-infamous ""palimony"" trial of actor Lee Marvin in 1979.

In those days, each local news station had its own artist, and the networks flew in their own for big cases. At the Marvin trial, she met Bill Robles, who is now the only other remaining sketch artist in Los Angeles and a friendly rival.

Over the years, there have been disagreements and the occasional jostling for prime seats in the courtroom, Robles said.

""There's competition, but it goes with the territory,"" he said. ""We're professionals and we always get the image.""

The two have worked alongside each other for decades, surviving all their counterparts who left the business, either by choice or lack of work.

Edwards, a freelancer, was reluctant to say what she charges media outlets for her drawings. But she said no matter the case, the process is always the same.

She first finds a feature that is prominent ??anything from a hair style to lips or a nose. Then she scopes out the person's body language, his posture and how his clothes fit. Then she draws the image in her mind, plans it out and starts the sketch.

""Before pen touches paper, I mentally complete the work,"" she said.

The key is to capture the person's spirit, to draw more than a mere portrait. It is up to her to do what a camera cannot, which is to capture the humanity in the room with a human's touch, she said.

""The cold eye of the camera doesn't pick up the essence of the story unfolding before you,"" she said. ""A camera doesn't capture the soul.""

?”â€”â€?
The killer known as the Night Stalker sat defiantly in a downtown Los Angeles courtroom. A few feet away sat Edwards, with her pen and pad.

She heard testimony of how he entered homes through open windows and shot, strangled, stabbed and raped his victims. She tried to capture his menacing stare and the terror he brought to all of California in the summer of 1985.

Then Ramirez turned to Edwards and offered a toothy smile.

""He was pure evil,"" she said. ""His eyes pierced me and my blood ran cold.""

Edwards' sketches are a who's who of notorious Los Angeles trials. There was the 1980s McMartin preschool child molestation case, one of the longest and costliest trials ever, and the 1990s trial of the Menendez brothers, who were convicted of killing their parents in a Beverly Hills mansion. There was the trial of the officers accused of beating Rodney G. King and the not-guilty verdicts that set off days of rioting in Los Angeles in 1992.

Judges often discreetly reach out to Edwards to buy a sketch after big trials, and attorneys are known to hang sketches of themselves in their offices.

Edwards, always dressed in a black pantsuit adorned with a Hermes scarf, is a vivacious presence in court. A role on the soap opera ""The Bold and the Beautiful"" put her in front of the camera. She was cast as a courtroom artist and sketched the attempted-murder trial of actress Hunter Tylo's character.

About six months later, Tylo was in Los Angeles County Superior Court after she sued Aaron Spelling for pregnancy discrimination.

""I actually drew Hunter Tylo in court after drawing her on TV,"" she said. ""This could only happen in L.A.""

?”â€”â€?
An artist sketched the Salem witch trials of 1692 and documented the 1865 military tribunal of conspirators in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. The impeachment trials of Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson, also were captured in a drawing.

With the advent of photography and video, the 1935 trial of Richard Bruno Hauptmann in the murder of aviator Charles Lindbergh's son became a media hullabaloo ??including hidden newsreel cameras, clandestine radio broadcasts and flashbulb bursts.

The aggressive media coverage in the case prompted the American Bar Association to lobby the courts to prohibit cameras and radio, which they did for decades. Courts eventually loosened the reins. Federal courts, however, have long banned cameras.

Rule 1.150 of the California Rules of Court, adopted in 1984, gives state judges wide discretion in allowing televised trials.

The O.J. Simpson murder case, the so-called Trial of the Century, was among the first to be broadcast live on television.

""We all thought O.J. was the swan song for courtroom artists,"" Edwards said.

The prolonged media circus, however, was sharply criticized after Simpson's acquittal and is believed to have led to judges becoming more reluctant to allow cameras in the courtroom.

Ronald H. Rose, a retired Los Angeles County Superior Court judge, said the presence of cameras influences the behavior of those involved and can undermine the court's pursuit of justice. While on the bench, he'd ban the cameras more often than not.

Some attorneys grandstand, others get nervous and make mistakes, he said. Jurors take notice and may try to see newscasts of the trial, which is against the rules. Witnesses can hear the testimony of others on television, perhaps compromising their own memories.

""A courtroom is a place where people strive to really, truly see that justice is done,"" Rose said. ""I'm always afraid that it isn't going to be accomplished if we allow cameras.""

Edwards can easily blend in and bring into her drawings the feeling in the entire room.

""She's the public eye in the courtroom,"" Rose said. ""She's able to capture the emotion that is felt by everyone in the courtroom in a way that a camera never could.""

Edwards said she has never been busier. Although that could be attributed to judges moving away from allowing cameras, it could be the lack of artists who can do the job.

The fear of the day when she is no longer needed is always present. Sometimes the phone doesn't ring for weeks.

""I always wonder, is this the last job? Is this my last story?"" she said. ""But then the phone rings.""

Many of the items in its catalog are standard fair that you would expect to see in your local gun shop.
But over the last few years this company has insisted on having","Chiappa Firearms is an importer that provides American shooters with a variety of guns from around the world. Many of the items in its catalog are standard fair that you would expect to see in your local gun shop.
But over the last few years this company has insisted on having at least a few interesting options in its lineup guaranteed to turn people?™s heads. Chiappa has teamed up with Akkar Silah Sanayi Ltd. of Turkey to launch a series of break-action, tri-barrel shotguns. That?™s right, three barrels instead of just one or two.

The Triple Threat is based on a traditional two-barrel shotgun design. The lower barrels rest in a side-by-side configuration with a third barrel set on top. This pyramidal arrangement gives the shooter a single-barrel sight plane for aiming with all three barrels. While most defensive shotguns have fixed chokes, the barrels of the Triple Threat are threaded to accept Rem Choke style choke tubes. Five choke tubes are provided, ranging from Skeet to Full. The barrels are 18.5-inches long, and the overall length of the pistol-grip version is 27.75 inches. These measurements exceed the 18-inch barrel/26-inch overall minimum length requirements, so this shotgun can be sold over the counter without any additional tax stamps or federal forms.
The receiver features a skeletonized release lever, a tang-mounted safety switch and a large rounded trigger guard to house the single trigger. This gun has a matte-black receiver finish that matches the barrels. Opening the action resets the mechanical trigger mechanism to trip each firing pin once. The right barrel fires first, the left barrel second and the top barrel last. If only one or two rounds are fired, opening the action will reset the mechanism to start the right-left-top barrel sequence again once the shotgun is reloaded.
The overall fit and finish of the Triple Threat was superb. The release lever and hinge of the action were tight and smooth. The matte finish of the metal components was evenly applied and free of blemishes. The forearm and grip both feature high-quality hard wood and diamond-pattern checkering. The wood-to-metal fitting is expertly done and completely free of the gaping, rough spots or loose fit problems that show up with inferior craftsmanship. Even the interior of the receiver was precision cut and coated.
At the range, the Triple Threat proved to be more comfortable to shoot than expected. Short-barrel shotguns with pistol grips can be punishing to shoot. When testing the Chiappa 1887 T-Model last year, the nearly straight grip shape made it necessary to keep the T-model snugged into the hip with a support hand locked over the top of the barrel.
The Triple Threat was a different story. The forward weight of the three barrels mitigated felt recoil without feeling overly nose heavy. The support hand can comfortably ride under the barrels with a good grip around the forearm. The trigger provided a crisp, short break for all three pulls. Cutting down a shoulder stock to form a pistol grip turned out to be a brilliant solution for this shotgun.
A little trick that makes shooting shotguns, especially compact pistol grip models, more comfortable is to create a push-pull tension between the firing hand and the support hand. Push the forearm forward, while pulling back on the grip. The grip shape of the Triple Threat allows this push-pull tension to be used because the shooting wrist is straight in line with the barrels for maximum support. Leaving the grooved fin of the shoulder stock in place (instead of rounding it off) provides a natural indexing point to form this all-important solid, straight grip.

The Sore Loser Uprising
By Timothy Egan (New York Times)

After a week in which Donald Trump insulted babies and their mothers and war heroes and their families, and threw in fire marshals for good measure, the scariest thing to come out of his team of thugs and political mercenaries is this: the suggestion that civil unrest could follow if he?™s denied the presidency.

When the Supreme Court handed George W. Bush the White House in 2000 even though he lost the popular vote, Al Gore graciously conceded and faded away. When Mitt Romney lost to Barack Obama four years ago although his internal polls showed a Republican triumph, he congratulated the winner and went off to rediscover his many grandchildren.

Despite party-machine manipulation and considerable voting of the dead, the American institution that produces a peaceful transfer of power has survived.

But this year, facing a likely trouncing in November, Trump has signaled that he will try to bring down our democracy with him. His overlooked comment ???œI?™m afraid the election is going to be rigged????is the opening move in a scheme to delegitimize the outcome.

Because Trump is consistently barbaric and such a prolific liar, it?™s hard to sustain outrage over any one of his serial scandals. But his pre-emptive attack on the electoral process is very troubling.

To understand what Trump is up to, listen to his doppelgÃ¤nger, the veteran political operative Roger Stone. He will say things that even Trump will not say, usually as a way to allow Trump to later repeat some variant of them.

It was Stone who called a CNN commentator a ?œstupid Negro??and accused the Gold Star parents of Capt. Humayun Khan of being Muslim Brotherhood agents. And it was Stone who threatened to give out the hotel room numbers of unsupportive Republicans at the party convention, the better for the Trumpian mob to find them.

He tastes the food for the king to make sure it?™s not poison. If it doesn?™t kill Roger Stone, it will not kill Donald Trump.

Picking up on Trump?™s rigged-election meme, Stone told a right-wing news outlet that the electoral fix was already in: ?œThe government will be shut down if they attempt to steal this and swear Hillary in.??The outcome is fair only if Trump wins.

?œIf there?™s voter fraud, this election will be illegitimate, the election of the winner will be illegitimate, we will have a constitutional crisis, widespread civil disobedience,??he said.

It would be laughable if the campaign were simply laying down the grand excuse for the label that will follow the tyrant from Trump Tower after Nov. 8 ??loser. But Trump has crossed all barriers of precedent and civility, from waging an openly racist campaign to loose talk about nuclear weapons. He has challenged the independence of the judiciary system, and called for a religious test for entry into this nation. With this latest tactic, he?™s trying to destabilize the country itself after he?™s crushed.

Let?™s talk about the basis for his sore loser uprising ??the gaming of the system. Trump?™s casinos were rigged, as are all gambling parlors, in favor of the house. Italian soccer is rigged. But there is virtually no evidence of modern American elections being fixed.

Studying national elections from 2000 to 2014, and looking at 834 million ballots cast, Justin Levitt of Loyola Law School found a total of 31 instances of credible voter fraud. Yes, 31. The Bush administration, after a five-year investigation concluding in 2007, found no evidence of any organized effort to skew federal elections. A federal judge in Wisconsin found that ?œvirtually no voter impersonation occurs.??
Trump?™s evidence? ?œI just hear things and I just feel it.??Yeah, he hears things. Like Russia not actually taking over Crimea. Like President Obama not being an American citizen. Like the N.F.L. writing him an imaginary letter. ?œThe voter ID situation has turned out to be a very unfair development,??he said this week. ?œWe may have people vote 10 times.??
Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter
Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

He?™s right about the unfairness of voter identification, but not in the way he means it. As a slew of recent court rulings have shown, Republican-led efforts to deny the vote to millions of citizens has rigged the system against the poor, the disabled, ethnic minorities. A voter- suppression law in North Carolina targeted blacks ?œwith almost surgical precision,??an appeals court ruled.

Nationwide rigging, though difficult to do in a system with more than 9,000 voting jurisdictions, is more likely to come from Russian efforts at hacking voting machines, given Vladimir Putin?™s apparent attempt to tip things in favor of his fellow authoritarian, the unstable Donald Trump.

With his inability to process basic information, Trump has gone down this road before. After the 2012 contest, which Romney lost by nearly five million votes, Trump said: ?œThis election is a total sham and travesty. We are not a democracy.??The last statement, judging by the groundwork he?™s doing for this November, looks more like a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Los Angeles police officer fatally shoots man inside hospital
Posted on December 20, 2015 by Admin
Reuters

A Los Angeles police officer on Saturday fatally shot a man who officials said was reaching for a policeman?™s gun inside a Torrance, California hospital.

The shooting comes at a time of heightened scrutiny over police use of force in the wake of high-profile killings of unarmed black men, which have sparked waves of angry protests across the country since mid-2014.  

Los Angeles Police Commander Phillip Tingirides told reporters the man had been taken on Saturday afternoon to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center for treatment after his arrest earlier in the day.

Tingirides said witnesses reported the man as being calm and cooperative until the hospital was ready to release him, at which point he allegedly attacked officers and picked up a metal stool.

Tingirides said an attempt to subdue the man with a taser was unsuccessful. A witness told police the suspect then reached for an officer?™s gun when the policeman fired the fatal shot, Tingirides said.

Medical staff on hand were unable to keep the man alive, Tingirides added.

Help us bring attention to this injustice by joining in our tweetfest tomorrow!,"JOIN US FROM NOON - 2:00 PM ET ON 8/26/15 FOR THE #BUSTRACISM TWEETFEST DEMANDING THE PUBLICLY FUNDED NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY REMOVE THE BUST OF MARGARET SANGER, RACIST AND EUGENICIST.

Also, please call the Smithsonian at 888-317-2837 and demand they remove the bust!

Margaret Sanger is the founder of Planned Parenthood, the abortion giant that has been recently exposed by undercover videos committing the most abominable atrocities imaginable. With a founder like Sanger, this is par for the course. 

Read more about the exhibit and Margaret Sanger: http://goo.gl/YD6Oz6

The National Portrait Gallery, a publicly-funded Smithsonian museum, recently put up a bust of Margaret Sanger in their ?œStruggle for Justice??exhibit. Placing a self-admitted racist, who lobbied for the extinction of black people, near civil rights icons like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rosa Parks is incredibly offensive. 

Led by ?œMinisters Taking a Stand??(MTS), a group of patriotic black pastors, public opinion is mounting against this injustice. Stand with them and other organizations committed to racial equality.

Please tweet @NPG & @smithsonian directly and let them know you want them to remove the Margaret Sanger bust from their ?œStruggle for Justice??exhibit! Make sure to use the #BustRacism hashtag!

Sample Tweets:

It?™s disgraceful that the bust of racist Margaret Sanger is being displayed in @NPG?™s ?œStruggle for Justice"" exhibit. #BustRacism
 
I stand with my friend @ewjacksonsr. The @NPG must remove the bust of racist @PPFA founder Margaret Sanger immediately. #BustRacism
 
Thank you @alvedacking for standing for life and calling for @NPG to remove the bust of @PPFA racist founder Margaret Sanger. #BustRacism
 
Why is @NPG honoring eugenicist Margaret Sanger? She founded @PPFA which targets minority communities. #BustRacism
 
RT if you agree: The @NPG should NOT be honoring racist @PPFA founder Margaret Sanger. #BustRacism
 
 @NPG knows Margaret Sanger was a eugenicist who spoke at KKK meetings and communicated with Hitler sympathizers. Disgraceful. #BustRacism
 
Putting racist Margaret Sanger next to Dr. Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks in the ?œStruggle for Justice??exhibit is insulting. #BustRacism
 
Dear @NPG, what are you thinking? @CtrMedProgress exposes @PPFA illegal sale of baby parts & you honor their racist founder? #BustRacism

.@PPFA's #MargaretSanger: ?œBirth control must lead ultimately to a cleaner race.??#BustRacism @NPG

Why is @NPG still commemorating eugenicist #MargaretSanger? #BustRacism @PPFA http://goo.gl/YD6Oz6

""If not for the tiny camera on University of Cincinnati police officer Ray Tensing's uniform, the July 19 death of Samuel Dubose in Cincinnati would be just another racially-charged police shooting of an unarmed black man shrouded in questions.

""But footage from Tensing's body camera, which UC's police department required him to wear, revealed apparent lies in Tensing's statements about Dubose's death, as well as inconsistent statements by responding UC officers David Lindenschmidt Phillip Kidd. Their misleading assertions about the incident raise larger questions about what's happening when police aren't being filmed and whether law enforcement officers should be required to wear them. The Cincinnati Police Department?”a separate entity from the campus cops?”has also been involved in high-profile shootings in the past, but doesn't have body cameras for all its officers. 

""'This is the most asinine act I've ever seen a police officer make,' said Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters at a Wednesday press conference announcing a grand jury's decision to indict Tensing on murder and voluntary manslaughter charges. The video footage of Dubose's brutal shooting belied the cop's claim of facing mortal danger during the routine traffic stop over a missing license plate.

Democrats have just introduced The Handgun Trigger Safety Act, a bill that would make smart gun technology mandatory in all handguns.
Sen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) claim their bill is to limit criminals and children from accessing handguns.
If the bill is passed, gun dealers and manufacturers would be required by law to install the technology before a firearm could be transferred.
Basically, this means that either your fingerprint, bluetooth watch or bracelet, or some type of implanted microchip would be required to fire the weapon.
The bill states that the technology must be installed on all new handguns within 5 years. Furthermore, within 10 years, private gun dealers would be required to retrofit all used handguns they acquire with the smart gun technology as well. The bill does provide an allowance to reimburse private dealers their cost of installing the smart gun technology.
In addition, a second bill introduced by the ?œdemocratic dynamic duo??would grant 10 million dollars annually to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to research gun violence and firearms safety.
That one perplexes me. Guns are not a disease. Why throw money at the CDC to do a job (teaching firearms safety) that the NRA has done effectively for over a century?
Sen. Markey stated:
?œThe epidemic of gun violence in America is not preordained, it is preventable. In the 21st century, we should use research and advances in technology to our advantage and save lives from tragic and needless gun violence.
These bills will keep guns out of the hands that of those who shouldn?™t have them.??What Sen. Markey fails to realize is that the black market is already flooded with countless handguns. I suppose he?™s expecting street thugs to march right down to their nearest gun shops to comply with a new smart gun law.
The bills co-sponsor, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) stated, ?œThe majority of Americans support sensible steps to reduce the bloodshed in our streets, schools, churches and other public spaces.??Sensible steps, yes. However, this IS NOT a sensible step. This would become a law that only responsible gun owners would comply with, and responsible gun owners already make sure criminals and children can?™t access their firearms. Hence, the term RESPONSIBLE.
This bill is nothing more than a ?œfeel good bill; smoke and mirrors,??all while squandering your precious tax dollars.

https://www.facebook.com/TheFirstAcademy

----
From my point of view it all starts in athletics. My family was drawn to TFA with the understanding of a safe Christian environment that pushed for academic success and had outstanding athletics in that order of priority. Sadly none of this was true. 

Besides the weekly chapels the so called Christian atmosphere was almost non-existent. African American students that attend are almost all either athletes brought on through illegal recruitment or children of the few (if any at times) African American instructors at the school. 

This is a school more worried about making sure they have enough black talent on their football and basketball team than instilling the the heart and mind if Christ inside of the students. They love you when you're on the field but you experience hate in the hallways. 

Ignorant and misinformed students ask questions and have conversations (like the one that transpired on Instagram) all the time. We all got treated like threats and were watched closely at all times. If there was a theft or girls complaining of inappropriate talk or touching, we were the first to be questioned. 

During the duration of the football regular season I witnessed older black students illegally recruited from Pine Hills (one of the black neighborhoods in the Orlando Area) allowed to sag their pants and wear gold chains and earrings against the dress code policy. But after a winning season and doing all the work that that the massa asked them too, they were harshly reprimanded for their dress. 

Some fell into compliance and others were angry after being aloud to do one thing and then later ridiculed for seemingly no reason. They were dismissed from the academy. I was one of three black kids in my 6th grade class until one of them left because his grandmother did not agree with the underlying racist culture at the school. 

We were often asked question like ""Why are you so dark?"", ""Why is you hair like that? It looks funny."", ""What is it like in the hood?"", ""Do you want to be a 'gangsta'?"" and many more belittling and demeaning questions like these. My family was not in the best of financial situations because we were dishing out money for the ridiculously high tuition. As a result, I couldn't get all the clothes and stuff that I wanted. I was made fun of often because

I wore older and used uniforms and my shoes were not new even though they were all my hard working parents could get me at the time. This made me feel lesser than my peers and lower than dirt in a so called ""Christian"" school. 

It is a good thing I had two loving parents that are were true believers, pastors, and examples of how to show the love of Christ or I would have completely turned my back on the church. Please excuse the long winded nature of my email but unfortunately this is only a fraction of the what goes on in that school. I have heard a lot of things from my friends and former students about the lascivious sex culture, partying and the cover ups. But I can only speak to what I have personally experienced. Thank you for reading and listening.  God bless.","www.TheFirstAcademy.org ??A K4-12th Grade, Christ-centered college preparatory school

#Republican #TeaParty Greed & Obstructionism is Literally Destroying America

Here Are Fifteen Things You May Not Know About America?™s Infrastructure. 

#1 One-third of America's major roads are in poor or mediocre condition.

#2 Traffic on more than half the miles of interstate highway exceeds 70 percent of capacity, and nearly 25 percent of the miles are strained at more than 95 percent of capacity.

#3 Americans waste 4.2 billion hours and 2.8 billion gallons fuel a year sitting in traffic ??equal to nearly one full work week and three weeks??worth of gas for every traveler.

#4 Over the next 30 years, our nation is expected to grow by 100 million and highway traffic will double again. Even if highway capacity grows no faster than in the last 25 years, Americans can expect to spend 160 hours ??4 work weeks ??each year in traffic by 2035.

#5 Nearly a third of all highway fatalities are due to substandard road conditions, obsolete road designs, or roadside hazards.

#6 Over 4,095 dams are ""unsafe"" and have deficiencies that leave them more susceptible to failure, especially during large flood events or earthquakes.

#7 Rolling blackouts and inefficiencies in the U.S. electrical grid cost an estimated $80 billion a year.

#8 By 2020, every major U.S. container port is projected to at least double the volume of cargo it was designed to handle. Some East Coast ports will triple in volume, and some West Coast ports will quadruple.

#9 Other countries are leapfrogging past us by investing in world-class ports. China is investing $6.9 billion; the port of Shanghai now has almost as much container capacity as all U.S. ports combined.

#10 By 2020, China plans to build 55,000 miles of highways, more than the total length of the U.S. interstate system. 

#11 According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, more than 25 percent of America's nearly 600,000 bridges need significant repairs or are burdened with more traffic than they were designed to carry.

#12 More than a third of all dam failures or near failures since 1874 have happened in just the last decade.

#13 All across the United States, conditions at many state parks, recreation areas and historic sites are deplorable at best. Some states have backlogs of repair projects that are now over a billion dollars long. 

#14 Over the past year, approximately 100 of New York's state parks and historic sites have had to cut services and reduce hours.

#15 All over America, asphalt roads are being ground up and are being replaced with gravel because it is cheaper to maintain. The state of South Dakota has transformed over 100 miles of asphalt road into gravel over the past year, and 38 out of the 83 counties in the state of Michigan have transformed at least some of their asphalt roads into gravel roads.

The Republican/Tea Party is fulfilling Bin Laden?™s plan.

A section of the interview was replayed on Tuesday morning?™s Fox & Friends, with Toon?™s version of events promoted by the Fox anchors as providing a fuller picture than the seven-minute YouTube video.""

""What Toon has failed to mention, though, is that he was part of a group of adults that, according to teens at the pool party, initially made racist comments to the mostly black youths, sparking a violent fight.""

""...Toon was among four teens charged with breaking into a barn, beating at least 12 turkeys to death, and spray-painting the animals with his school?™s colors to celebrate a football victory. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice confirmed to BuzzFeed News he spent 285 days in jail. Records show he was also arrested in 1999 for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.""

Out of Darkness is a full length three-part documentary by director Amadeuz Christ examining the untold history of African people, the African cultural contribution to the nations of the world, and the events that have contributed to the condition of African people today.

The first in a series of short films chronicling the history of African Americans in the military, ""Freedom?™s Fortress: Escape to Freedom"" tells the story of how Fortress Monroe (now Fort Monroe National Monument) in Virginia became the site of the first contraband camp, a spontaneous community of self-emancipated blacks where inhabitants often became recruits for military service.

The four films provide a fresh perspective on African Americans??struggles for civil rights in the military. Created for high school students, the films take viewers from Virginia to Vietnam and from the enslaved to the commemorated. Watch the whole series here: http://go.nps.gov/m6c5xw

If you have something hateful, bigoted, or otherwise mocking to say of the victims of Orlando, then seriously get the f-ck off my page and don't ever come back. I mean it. Get the f-ck out of here, because you're a piece of shit in my opinion. 

Yeah, what I'm about to say may not be the most popular thing for some people, but I don't care. What's right is right and what's wrong is wrong, and you assholes thinking it's funny, or that those poor people deserved what happened are wrong. 

We're all Americans, period. We're Americans, and we have the right to live our lives the way we each feel is best for us. You don't have to agree with anyone, but it's your duty as an American to support their choices, because it's those choices that people in other nations would dream to be able to make. Our freedom was attacked today. All of our freedom. Not just homosexuals, not just Floridians, all of ours. Each and every one of us was assaulted today, and if you're too blind to see it, then you're no American, you're a bigoted piece of shit who's blinded by your hatred for that with which you disagree.

This was a group of Americans exercising their right to peacefully assemble, and they were viciously attacked by a freedom hating Islamist intent on causing the most possible death and destruction possible. It could have been any of us. It could have been your children at school or your girlfriend at a different club. It could have been your brother at a concert or it your mother at a restaurant. It could have been you at an amusement park or your husband at a football game. 

It.could.have.been.any of us. 

Don't you get it? Don't you get that when your fellow countrymen are attacked, it's as good as an attack on you or your family? Don't you realize that regardless of the venue, when Americans are killed it takes something from all of us? Are you that twisted and sick that you're willing to allow your ideology to convince you that people with whom you disagreed deserved to die? Who cares if they were gay, straight, black, white, liberal, conservative or whatever? They were Americans, and what happened to them was an utter travesty regardless of how you look at it.

If you do think they deserved it or deserve to be mocked after the fact, then you're nobody I want anything to do with. In fact, you're a lowlife piece of shit who has zero concept of America and why we have the freedoms we do. I'll gladly stand with the victims of Orlando, regardless of their lifestyle, political leaning, or anything else, before I stand with anyone who says that any of my fellow countrymen deserved to be massacred at the hands of an Islamic extremist just because of who they love. 

Fuck you. Unlike my page and don't ever comment again, because if I see you I'm going to report your comment and ban you anyway. You disgust me, and I'm not going to tolerate you or anything you stand for because what you stand for is in contrast to this nation and the values it was founded upon. I can't believe anybody would ever be that way, let alone people claiming to be patriotic Americans fighting the good fight. Well here's a newsflash - you're not fighting a good fight. In fact, what you're doing stands in complete contrast to why this nation was founded. 

So congratulations, you assholes. You've not only made yourselves look like complete douchebags, but you've undermined the very cause you believe you're fighting for. 

Freedom isn't just for those you agree with - it's for everyone, and it's up to us to stand up for it and protect it at all costs, especially when it's for people with whom we disagree...

As a side note it's very interesting to note that the National Labor Union and the Ku Klux Klan were both formed in 1866. The NLU was trying to protect jobs for White Men because now the former Slaves could compete for the jobs and we had most of the skills and were just as good if not better than they were because we held these types of jobs for 240 years but didn't get paid. There were 262 Skills, Trades and Crafts that the Slaves had up until 1865. Read ""The Other Slaves: Mechanics, Artisans, and Craftsmen"" by James Newton and Ronald Lewis. 

The Ku Klux Klan was a terrorist organization formed in 1866 in Pulaski, Tennessee to terrorize, intimidate, and control the former Slaves.

I pulled my cell phone out and recorded Pastor Stephan Brody calling out Planned Parenthood and what they are doing to blacks in America and then hits the church hard!

On the way out my son, who I thought wasn't listening ask if we could stop shopping at 
Walmart, target and Home Depot.

I told him that when we got home we would research and see if they indeed do fund planned parenthood.  If so, yes we will email them and Facebook post on their page and let them know.

Ah Yes, The Good Old Days... How Soon We Forget 

Up until 1965, most African Americans were not allowed to vote in the South. White people in power used many methods to keep Black people from voting. Some of these methods prevented poor White people from voting as well. 

Here Are Just Eight Of The Ways People Were Kept From Voting
See If Any Of Them Sound Familiar

1. Violence: Blacks who tried to vote were threatened, beaten, and killed. Their families were also harmed. Sometimes their homes were burned down. Often, they lost their jobs or were thrown off their farms.
Whites used violence to intimidate blacks and prevent them from even thinking about voting. Still, some blacks passed the requirements to vote and took the risk. Some whites used violence to punish those ?œuppity??people and show other blacks what would happen to them if they voted.

2. Literacy Tests: Today almost all adults can read. One hundred years ago, however, many people ??black and white ??were illiterate. Most illiterate people were not allowed to vote. A few were allowed if they could understand what was read to them. White officials usually claimed that whites could understand what was read. They said blacks could not understand it, even if they could.

3. Property Tests: In the South one hundred years ago, many states allowed only property owners to vote. Many blacks and whites had no property and could not vote.

4. Grandfather Clause: People who could not read and owned no property were allowed to vote if their fathers or grandfathers had voted before 1867. Of course, practically no blacks could vote before 1867, so the grandfather clause worked only for whites.

5. All-White Primary Elections: In the United States, there are usually two rounds of elections: first the primary, then the general. In the primary, Republicans run against Republicans and Democrats run against Democrats. In the general election, the winner of the Republican primary runs against the winner of the Democratic primary. The Republican or Democrat who gets the most votes is elected.
In the South from about 1900 to about 1960, the Democratic candidates usually won. Republicans were almost never elected, especially in the Deep South. This means that the Democratic primary election was usually the only election that mattered. 
African Americans were not allowed to vote in the Democratic primary elections. White Democrats said the Democratic Party was a ?œclub??and did not allow black members. So blacks could not vote in the only elections that mattered.

6. Purges: From time to time, white officials purged the voting rolls. That means they took people?™s names off the official lists of voters. Some voters would arrive at the polls and find that they were not registered to vote. Often they could not register to vote again until after the election. Purges more often affected blacks than whites.

7. Former Prisoners: People who had gone to prison were often not allowed to vote. Blacks were very often arrested on trumped-up charges or for minor offenses. Sometimes, white owners of mines, farms, and factories simply needed cheap labor, and prisons provided it. This law kept many more blacks from voting than whites.

8. Poll Taxes: In Southern states, people had to pay a tax to vote. The taxes were about $25 to $50 dollars in today?™s money. Many people had extremely low incomes and could not afford this tax. This poll tax applied to all people who wanted to vote ??black and white. There were ways for whites to get around other laws, but not around the poll tax. Many poor whites could not vote because of the poll tax.

In 1965, Congress Passed The Voting Rights Act. Millions Of African Americans Began Voting As A Result. This Act Is Generally Considered The End Of The Jim Crow Era, Or So We Thought.",,12/08/2016 00:00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All of the real problems in the world and this person wants to spearhead a campaign against sexist restroom signs?,"
Well, liberals have shown enough outrage to get the Confederate flag taken down nearly everywhere.
Then, TV Land canned re-runs of the Dukes of Hazzard because the General Lee proudly displays the Democratic staple on its hood.
What?™s next?
Are female restroom signs offensive because women are wearing dresses instead of pants?
Yep.
From Daily Caller:
The Huffington Post is exhilarated about a Seattle-based feminist?™s ?œtruly glorious??dream to produce and sell a Badass Feminist Coloring Book.
The would-be author of the Badass Feminist Coloring Book is Ijeoma Oluo, who bills herself as ?œa feminist writer and speaker??in her Kickstarter funding appeal.
The Badass Feminist Coloring Book, if it becomes a reality, will contain stark, black, white and gray images of feminists along with quotes by those people.
For example, the quote under Hari Kondabolu is: ?œWe live in a world that is so sexist that women still can?™t wear pants on public restroom signs??Kondabolu is a graduate of Bowdoin College who is eking out a living as a comedian. (Annual tuition, fees and room and board at Bowdoin is $61,354.)
If Seth Meyers and Amy Poehler weren?™t such hardcore, radical Lefties, this would make for a perfect debate on SNL?™s Weekend Update during the Really? with Seth and Amy segment (I know they haven?™t been on the show for a while).
Another feminist featured in the prototype of the coloring book is Jenny Yang. She looks very angry in Oluo?™s rendering of her. Yang?™s quote is: ?œFind your fury.??A third feminist featured in the prospective book is Michi Trota, a self-described community organizer who writes about geek culture.
Trota?™s quote in the Badass Feminist Coloring Book is: ?œYour argument is invalid. Deal with it.??Oluo shows Trota crouched in some kind of ninja battle stance, wielding two blazing torches as weapons.
Hey, wait a minute! Restroom signs depicting men and women are racist, too! They?™re always white!
Liberal logic, for ya.
Obviously, we can?™t paint the female sign pink ??that would cause feminists the world over to faint. What to do, what to do?

They apparently have the IQ of a mop....oh wait no they don't even it has a use.....learn some history other then from a PUBLIC school cause apparently they don't teach people everything. And definitely don't teach them that EVERYONE has freedom NOT just gays, blacks, whites, North or the South. I love my gay friends I really do and I want them to be happy but YOU can't force yourself and your beliefs on others and expect them to be OK with it. And another thing the war you people keep screaming is over slavery blah blah blah that was some yes however did you know that only 25% of people in the South owed slaves? Did you know that the Generals for the Northern side didn't release their slaves till Dec and the war ended in May??? Did you know he's in the history books as saying the reason he didn't release them is ""cheep labor is hard to find?"" I mean for people that was wanting your rights, you are the first ones to try and take others. And I know plenty of interracial couples that are happy as can be living right here in the South. And the care act you are so supporting did you know other countries have tried it before including Canada? And they was warring us not to do it? Did you know the day that went in to affect 1000s of people lost their jobs????? Do you even care? No cause your to ""smart"" to see the big picture about what's going on..... And another thing our ancestors lost that war NOT us. I'd think you guys may have a lil more respect being most military comes from the South but guess that don't matter right?  There is only one race that's human. If you don't like that then you need to apologize to the tree that's working its a** off making oxygen for you. Taking a flag away isn't going to fix anything, taking gays rights away isn't going to fix anything whites killing blacks and blacks killing blacks isn't going to fix anything. Try something new, how about being an American and live side by side with the differences that make this America and free.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AUSTIN, Texas ??A suspect was shot in the shoulder and bit by a K9 after threatening people with knives in north Austin, according to police.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The initial 911 call came in just after 5 p.m. Sunday evening. According to police, the caller reported a man armed with a knife threatening another man in a business parking lot in the 9800 block of Interstate 35. While officers were en route to the scene, 911 dispatchers received more calls about the same man armed with a knife.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Once on scene, police say they located the man hiding behind a business and armed with multiple knives. Police say they instructed the suspect to drop the knives but instead he fled on foot. The suspect then ran across the northbound I-35 frontage road, both northbound and southbound lanes of the interstate, according to police. Surveillance video shows part of the chase as the man hopped a brick wall trying to escape authorities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Austin Police say the officer who fired the weapon instructed the suspect to drop the knives multiple times but he did not comply.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
He gave commands to the suspect. We can hear in the in-car camera multiple commands to drop the knives. We can hear the officer broadcast to dispatch that he has the suspect at gunpoint giving him commands but he's not compliant. Again, multiple commands to drop the knives and then at this point you can hear gunfire on the in-car camera," says APD Assistant Chief Brian Manley. APD confirms they recovered two """"butcher style knives"""" at the scene.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Manley explains, APD dispatched EMS to the scene in the event the suspect was injured by the gunfire. However, police say the suspect instead initiated a lengthy foot pursuit. According to police, the suspect also received a gunshot wound to the shoulder during his earlier encounter with police.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Austin Travis County EMS personnel confirm they did transport a 30's aged male to University Medical Center Brackenridge with serious but non-life threatening injuries. Austin police say the suspect is a 34-year-old black male. Police say they do not know why he was allegedly threatening people with knives in the first place.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
APD is not identifying anyone involved in the incident. However, they did say the officer involved in the shooting has been placed on administrative duty, which is standard procedure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

7.9954E+14,Shaun King,799539910084929_1171511086221141,SHAUN KING: Young football team has season canceled for taking a knee,"All over the country, young people continue to take a knee during the Star Spangled Banner to protest police brutality and racial injustice in America. For them, perhaps because the world has not yet squeezed out all of their hope and optimism, or maybe because they know they have far more time left on this earth than 70-year-old Donald Trump, they each feel like taking a knee is a risk worth taking. Beautifully, they still believe this country can change. Hell, that's what's what we taught them ??the United States has had high highs and low lows, but after real struggles, it can change.

Disturbingly, perhaps no young athletes in America have paid the price for this demonstration like the young 11 and 12-year-old boys of the Beaumont Bulls football team in Beaumont, Texas. Situated between Houston to the west and Lafayette, Louisiana to the east, Beaumont is one of the many Texas towns which lives and breathes football. Many families in Beaumont have now been playing the game for generations. It's what you do.

So, when the San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick decided during the NFL preseason to not stand for national anthem, it didn't take long for the echoes to be heard in Beaumont. Students, coaches, and parents there not only follow the league closely, but feel like the plight of injustice in America is their own. Police brutality, wrongful arrests and racial violence plague black folk in Texas and Louisiana. Within days of Kaepernick staging his protest, the coaching staff of the Beaumont Bulls, led by head coach Rah-Rah Barber, privately discussed the possibility them taking a knee before their next game, before ultimately deciding against it. The coaches didn't want to impose anything on the players. To their surprise, though, the young boys came to them and told them they wanted to take a knee. The shooting deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile at the hands of police just two months prior had not only shaken Kaepernick and the Beaumont Bulls coaching staff, they deeply bothered the young students as well.

So, on Sept. 10, after getting permission from league officials, the staff and students of the Beaumont Bulls football team took a knee before their game. They won 27-0 and garnered national attention for their demonstration. Within 24 hours, the kids and their families began receiving death threats and racist taunts both online and off. The executive board of the team and the league issued strong statements of support backing the boys, but within a few days it all began eroding.

With very little explanation, in spite of the previous support, the Beaumont Bulls students, staff, and parents were told by their executive board not to take a knee in their following game on Sept. 17, but they defied the request and did it anyway. Again, they won their game, and the team was unified, but the bottom was about to fall out. The boys were scheduled to have a bye the following week. During that time, the executive board made a decision that shocked the whole league. They suspended Coach Rah-Rah Barber, who was not only a great coach, but a mentor and hero to many of the boys, for the rest of the season.

The board, in an email obtained by Bleacher Report, denied that the coach's suspension was due to the protests ??instead blaming the situation on Barber's removing a player and coach from the team and an improperly distributed text message.

Many parents, speaking directly to the Daily News, communicated that they were banned from the team and told that while their sons would be allowed to continue playing if they wanted to, the parents were no longer allowed to attend games, practices, or events. If they did, they would be arrested.

Instead of supporting the boys and their protests, the executive board abandoned them. It was a devastating and extreme move to make. Speaking to Adam Harris of the Bleacher Report, an assistant coach for the team, Alfred Dean, who is also a six-year Army veteran, said of Coach Barber, ""He really cares about these kids. What people don't realize is that we're not getting paid for this.""

Coach Dean, who had also taken a knee with the team, decided it was just too much and submitted his resignation. Understandably, the players were crushed. They wanted to continue the protest, but wanted to continue playing the game they love as well, but were left without their leaders. So, they decided to do the only thing they truly knew to do, they protested the firing of Coach Barber by not attending their next practice until he was brought back on board.

Determined to play a game of chicken with these young boys, the executive board decided that instead of reinstating the coaches and allowing the protests, they'd simply cancel the rest of the season ??and that's exactly what they did, the parents say. The Beaumont Bulls, in spite of paying fees for a full season, and being in the league playoff race, had the rug pulled out from under them. No sports team in the country has faced this much opposition in response to Star Spangled Banner protests.

These young boys and their coaches are heroes. Millions of people all over the world have seen their photos and read about their demonstration. Colin Kaepernick himself proudly shared their story on social media and communicated to the team that he supported them.

That adults have now canceled their season, and denied these young boys a chance to fight on, is a travesty. It's gravely immature and short-sighted of team and league officials to allow it all to go down like this. What lessons does this teach the kids? What has it taught them about their right to protest? What has it taught them about quitting or playing through adversity?

It's not too late. While the whole thing is a mess, the team and the league still has time to reinstate Coaches Barber and Dean, apologize to the boys and their parents, and allow them to finish their season with dignity. I was about to say that this would require the adults to act like adults, but I'm afraid that that's what messed the whole thing up in the first place. Adults today are too often petty and mean-spirited. Just take a look at our presidential race. Instead, we need the adults in this situation to stop thinking about their egos and think instead of the young boys of the Beaumont Bulls. Salvaging their season should be the top priority right now. Anything short of that would be a failure.

Boys ??you've done well. You were right to take a knee for injustice. You were right to follow the lead of so many NFL players. You were right to keep doing it even when they told you not to. You did not create this mess. It's not your fault. I am incredibly proud of each and every one of you.

6934857868,Mike Huckabee,6934857868_10153930750417869,,"My response to Joe Belz in World Magazine was published in the latest issue.  Here it is below:

Editor?™s note: Joel Belz in WORLD?™s July 9 issue noted that ?œTed Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Rick Perry, and Scott Walker all eventually had to tell their evangelical backers that 2016 just wasn?™t the year,??and he went on to say the problem was not just evangelical followers but evangelical leaders. Huckabee asked for space to reply, and given his long record of service we agreed. Here?™s his response.

Blood and Scars

Joel Belz opined that candidates like me have not had ?œstrong enough biblical and philosophical understanding of issues, big enough leadership skills, a clean enough personal record, and courage enough to take the risks and pay the price of getting out front.??The column summarily dismissed a lifetime of service and asked, ?œIs this handful of folks the best we can produce???

In the 1970s I helped launch Southern Baptists for Life, led the organization of the Freedom Rally in 1979 that inspired several evangelical/political movements including the Moral Majority, and helped execute the National Affairs Briefing in Dallas in 1980 when Ronald Reagan secured the support of many evangelical leaders. 
During the 1980s, I left a career in media and advertising and pastored churches, served as a denominational leader, and launched Christian television stations. I led efforts to pass an amendment to the Arkansas Constitution affirming the state?™s duty to protect human life from conception. I successfully fought ballot efforts to create a lottery that exploits the poor. 

Belz lamented those who lacked the ?œcourage to take the risks and pay the price.??I walked away from a comfortable salary, pension, and insurance to run for public office. I cashed in life savings, insurance policies, and annuity plans while I first sought public office over 25 years ago. Defeated in my first quest, I came back a year later to shock the Clinton political machine in my state to become lieutenant governor, only the fourth Republican to ever be elected. The political establishment nailed shut the door to my Capitol office for 59 days, but I was reelected and two years later became governor when my predecessor was convicted of felonies and forced to resign. 

I accept the verdict of the voters, but not the trite dismissal that guys like me lacked the background, leadership, or experience.
I served 10 1/2 years as the chief executive of my state, reelected twice by voters, including 48 percent of African-Americans and over 40 percent of Hispanics. I led the state to reform welfare to workfare, rebuilt the entire interstate highway system with 80 percent approval of the state?™s voters, cut taxes 97 times, created prevention-based healthcare solutions that were nationally recognized, and took on the teachers unions and fought corruption in the state ingrained during the Clintonista years. Numerous public officials went to jail. 

Time named me one of the five best governors in the nation, Governing magazine honored me as ?œPublic Official of the Year,??and my fellow governors entrusted me as chair of the National Governors Association. 

I led my state in response to numerous natural disasters such as an ice storm, floods, and tornadoes, and was praised for the handling of the largest number (by percentage) of evacuees from Hurricane Katrina of any state. 

I led the way toward and signed numerous pieces of pro-life and pro-family legislation. 

I ran for president in 2008: Evangelicals said they agreed with me but wanted a ?œseat at the table??of the candidate the press predicted would win. I still came in second to John McCain for the nomination. In 2016, I ran again, after encouragement and promised support from evangelicals who later reneged and gave it to candidates they said ?œhad money and could win.??

Donald Trump has money, and he?™s proven he can win. I accept the verdict of the voters, but not the trite dismissal that guys like me lacked the background, leadership, or experience. In the public square I stuck to my convictions. I wasn?™t always successful, but I was always faithful. 

In the movie Eye in the Sky, a British military officer says to a politician, ?œNever tell a soldier he doesn?™t know the cost of war.??Never tell someone who has made my journey he didn?™t ?œtake the risks or pay the price of getting out front.??I was out front. Do better than blaming those of us who left the arena with blood streaming down our faces and the scars forever etched in our political flesh.",,30/07/2016 00:00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have to give Governor John Kasich points for consistency. He went on CNN http://ow.ly/10Bc04 and doubled down on his view that values issues just aren't that important. Referring to Mississippi's religious liberty law, Kasich said:
""I read about this thing they did in Mississippi where apparently you can deny somebody service because they're gay. What the hell are we doing in this country? . . . We had a Supreme Court ruling, and you know what, let's move on.""
Not only did Kasich embrace the language of the left in grossly distorting Mississippi's law, he embraced the left's strategy for fundamentally redefining America.
Not that long ago, fighting judicial activism was a key pillar of conservatism. Sadly, too many GOP elites are willing to let unelected judges dictate our values. That is wrong, and the Supreme Court often gets it wrong, too.
The Supreme Court made a ruling in Dred Scott that said black men and women were not people, but property. Thankfully, we didn't just accept it and ""move on.""
The Supreme Court made a ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson upholding segregation. That was wrong. The Supreme Court made a ruling in Roe v. Wade, declaring that unborn children were property to be disposed of at a whim. That has been a disaster.

""Homer Plessy was a 30 year old, light-skinned man who could easily pass for white. Whatever his complexion, because of the one drop-rule, Plessy was considered a black man.

On June 7th, 1892, Plessy boarded a white railroad car on the East Louisiana Railroad. The situation was planned, a direct response to Louisiana?™s Separate Car Act of 1892. Black civil rights organizations took to the courts to challenge the law, and Plessy deliberately sat in the white section and identified himself as a black man.""

"" Ukraine is home to Svoboda, arguably Europe?™s most influential far-right movement today. Party leader Oleh Tyahnybok is on record complaining that his country is controlled by a ""Muscovite-Jewish mafia,"" while his deputy derided the Ukrainian-born film star Mila Kunis as a ""dirty Jewess."" In Svoboda?™s eyes, gays are perverts and black people unfit to represent the nation at Eurovision, lest viewers come away thinking Ukraine is somewhere besides Uganda.

Svoboda began life in the mid-90s as the Social-National Party (a name deliberately redolent of the National Socialist Party, better known as Nazis), with its logo the fascist Wolfsangel. In 2004, the party gave itself an unobjectionable new name (Svoboda means ""Freedom"") and canned the Nazi imagery, and in the subsequent decade has seen its star swiftly rise.
Today, Svoboda holds a larger chunk of its nation?™s ministries (nearly a quarter, including the prized defense portfolio) than any other far-right party on the continent. Ukraine?™s deputy prime minister represents Svoboda (the smaller, even more extreme ""Right Sector"" coalition fills the deputy National Security Council chair), as does the prosecutor general and the deputy chair of parliament ??where the party is the fourth-largest. And Svoboda?™s fresh faces are scarcely different from the old: one of its freshmen members of parliament is the founder of the ""Joseph Goebbels Political Research Centre"" and has hailed the Holocaust as a ""bright period"" in human history.

Nowhere has this death of nuance been more apparent than in the Ukraine crisis. In December, shortly after protests began against Ukraine?™s pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych, U.S. Senator John McCain shared a platform and an embrace with Svoboda chief Tyahnybok at a mass rally in Kiev, assuring demonstrators, ""The free world is with you; America is with you."" In February of this year, France and Germany oversaw a peace deal between Tyahnybok, two other opposition leaders, and Yanukovych (though soon after, protests forced Yanukovych to flee to Russia). And in early March, the U.S. State Department published a debunking of Putin?™s ""False Claims About Ukraine,"" assuring Americans that Ukraine?™s far-right ""are not represented"" in parliament.

Meanwhile, in the lead-up to the March 16 referendum on Crimea?™s annexation to Russia, Svoboda was busier than ever. One of its chief demands ??that all government business be done in Ukrainian ??was passed into law, instantaneously marginalizing the one-third of Ukraine?™s citizens (and 60 percent of Crimeans) who speak Russian.

He is white but worked in an all black neighborhood for 20 years. He is Catholic and had 5 children, two he adopted were special needs children, he LOVES dogs and has been self employed most of his life.  So, why do I write about him?  Because he is doing what many will this year, for the first time ever he will Vote for a Democrat for President.  He would never think of not voting, he has always been a responsible citizen, gun owner and he still takes care of his adult son who is disabled.  But this story is bigger than him voting for Hillary.  He has been so appalled by Trump that his personal morals, integrity and values no longer allow him to associate with people who LOVE the guy who hates the same people they hate.  I think it was when Trump made fun of the disabled reporter that was a two by four that hit him in the head.  He has left clubs, removed friends from his life and has even expressed to his children that he will, and he hopes they will, support the only candidate that has the greater good as her priority and someone who thinks about the consequences of her actions on future generations.

4.37674E+14,We the People,437674196342052_875283162581151,Timeline Photos,"When contemplating illegal immigration, here is the transcript of a speech given by ex-Colorado Governor Dick Lamn (D) at a population conference in Washington DC in 2004 to consider:

 If you believe, as many do, that America is too smug, too white bread, too self-satisfied, too rich, lets destroy America. It is not that hard to do. History shows that nations are more fragile than their citizens think. No nation in history has survived the ravages of time. Arnold Toynbee observed that all great civilizations rise and they all fall, and that ""an autopsy of history would show that all great nations commit suicide."" here is my plan:

1. We must first make America a bilingual-bicultural country. History shows, in my opinion, that no nation can survive the tension, conflict, and antagonism of two competing languages and cultures. It is a blessing for an individual to be bilingual; it is a curse for a society to be bilingual. One scholar, Seymour Martin Lipset, put it this way: The histories of bilingual and bicultural societies that do not assimilate are histories of turmoil, tension, and tragedy. Canada, Belgium, Malaysia, Lebanon ---- all face crises of national existence in which minorities press for autonomy, if not independence. Pakistan and Cyprus have divided. Nigeria suppressed an ethnic rebellion. France faces difficulties with its Basques, Bretons, and Corsicans.

2. I would then invent ""multiculturalism"" and encourage immigrants to maintain their own culture. I would make it an article of belief that all cultures are equal: that there are no cultural differences that are important. I would declare it an article of faith that the black and hispanic dropout rate is only due to prejudice and discrimination by the majority. Every other explanation is out-of-bounds.

3. We can make the United States a ""hispanic Quebec"" without much effort. The key is to celebrate diversity rather than unity. As Benjamin Schwarz said in the Atlantic Monthly recently:
...achieved not by tolerance but by hegemony. Without the dominance that once dictated ethnocentrically, and what it meant to be an American, we are left with only tolerance and pluralism to hold us together. 
I would encourage all immigrants to keep their own language and culture. I would replace the melting pot metaphor with a salad bowl metaphor. It is important to insure that we have various cultural sub-groups living in America reinforcing their differences rather than Americans, emphasizing their similarities.
4. Having done all this, I would make our fastest growing demographic group the least educated - I would add a second underclass, un-assimilated, undereducated, and antagonistic to our population. I would have this second underclass have a 50% drop out rate from school.

5. I would then get the big foundations and big business to give these efforts lots of money. I would invest in ethnic identity, and I would establish the cult of Victimology. I would get all minorities to think their lack of success was all the fault of the majority - I would start a grievance industry blaming all minority failure on the majority population.

6. I would establish dual citizenship and promote divided loyalties. I would ""Celebrate diversity."" ""Diversity"" is a wonderfully seductive word. It stresses differences rather than commonalities. Diverse people worldwide are mostly engaged in hating each other-that is, when they are not killing each other. A diverse,"" peaceful, or stable society is against most historical precedent. People undervalue the unity it takes to keep a nation together, and we can take advantage of this myopia. Look at the ancient Greeks. Dorf 's world history tells us: 

The Greeks believed that they belonged to the same race; they possessed a common language and literature; and they worshiped the same gods. All Greece took part in the olympic games in honor of Zeus and all Greeks venerated the shrine of Apollo at Delphi. A common enemy Persia threatened their liberty. Yet, all of these bonds together were not strong enough to overcome two factors . . . (local patriotism and geographical conditions that nurtured political divisions . . .) 
If we can put the emphasis on the ""pluribus,"" instead of the ""unum,"" we can balkanize America as surely as Kosovo.
7. Then I would place all these subjects off limits - make it taboo to talk about. I would find a word similar to ""heretic"" in the 16th century - that stopped discussion and paralyzed thinking. Words like ""racist"", ""xenophobe"" that halts argument and conversation. Having made america a bilingual-bicultural country, having established multiculturalism, having the large foundations fund the doctrine of ""Victimology"", I would next make it impossible to enforce our immigration laws. I would develop a mantra - ""that because immigration has been good for America, it must always be good."" I would make every individual immigrant sympatric and ignore the cumulative impact.

8. Lastly, I would censor Victor Davis Hanson's book ""Mexifornia."" This book is dangerous - it exposes my plan to destroy America. So please, please - if you feel that America deserves to be destroyed - please, please - don't buy this book! This guy is on to my plan.
""The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the Spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that Spectrum."" - Noam Chomsky, American linguist and US Media and Foreign Policy critic.
It sounds like Dick Lamn hit the nail on the head. 
However, the question we need to be asking ourselves and members of Congress is:
Why is the plan to destroy America being implemented?",,24/04/2016 00:00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this investigation, the Times interviewed more than 100 people, including former detainees in 12 countries, to get a sense of how life continues after suffering from torture.
Queen

""Americans have long debated the legacy of post-Sept. 11 interrogation methods, asking whether they amounted to torture or succeeded in extracting intelligence. But even as President Obama continues transferring people from GuantÃ¡namo and Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, promises to bring back techniques, now banned, such as waterboarding, the human toll has gone largely uncalculated.

At least half of the 39 people who went through the C.I.A.?™s ?œenhanced interrogation??program, which included depriving them of sleep, dousing them with ice water, slamming them into walls and locking them in coffin-like boxes, have since shown psychiatric problems, The New York Times found. Some have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, paranoia, depression or psychosis.

Hundreds more detainees moved through C.I.A. ?œblack sites??or GuantÃ¡namo, where the military inflicted sensory deprivation, isolation, menacing with dogs and other tactics on men who now show serious damage. Nearly all have been released.""","Beatings, sleep deprivation, menacing and other brutal tactics have led to persistent mental health problems among detainees held in secret C.I.A. prisons and at GuantÃ¡namo.",10/10/2016 00:00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The threatening tweet concluded with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter.

?œIM NOT GONNA STAND FOR THIS NO. MORE. TONIGHT WE PURGE! KILL ALL THE WHITE PPL IN THE TOWN OF LA PLATA #BlackLivesMatter??The La Plata police statement was posted to the Charles County Sheriff?™s Office Facebook page.

?œUPDATE: The La Plata Police Department identified the individual who tweeted the threat against La Plata residents. An arrest warrant has been obtained for Threats of Mass Violence. An arrest warrant was issued for:
?œHOLLINS, Carlos Anthony, B/M/6-02/140/Black Hair/Brown Eyes/D.O.B. 2/2/1995 of Waldorf, Maryland.
?œAt 2047 hours, Mr. Hollins was taken into custody without incident by the Charles County Sheriff?™s Office in Waldorf.
?œOn September 2, 2015 at approximately 4:43 p.m. the La Plata Police Department was alerted to a threat of violence against La Plata residents that was made on social media. The agency is working with allied law enforcement agencies to establish the credibility of the threat and the identity of the individual. The tweet read: IM NOT GONNA STAND FOR THIS NO. MORE. TONIGHT WE PURGE! KILL ALL THE WHITE PPL IN THE TOWN OF LA PLATA???œMore information will be forthcoming. The Department has added extra officers to patrol in an effort to protect the public.??BayNet.com reported Hollins has a minor criminal record.
?œCourt records show a peace order was issued against Hollins in April of 2014 and it expired seven months later. He was also previously charged with trespassing in 2013. Those cases have been closed. There is no information on when Hollins will be in court for a hearing on this latest charge.??A short video was posted at 7:41 p.m. EDT to the Twitter account that originated the threat, @_TRVPCOCAINE, claiming the poster was at a police station getting ready to turn himself in.

This guy has an amazing amount of heart.,"A state trooper is making national headlines, but not for any of the typical reasons. He didn?™t shoot an unarmed black teen or any of the usual nonsense that makes the news. What he actually did will warm your heart.
Law enforcement was getting a lot of calls about an elderly woman traveling a state route alongside cars and semis on her scooter, so Dave Hintz with the Washington State Patrol stopped to see if he could be of service to her.

?œI wasn?™t trying to stop her. I wasn?™t trying to detain her. I was just trying to get her back to her home,??explained Hintz, who humbly said he was just treating the woman the way he ?œwould?™ve wanted someone to treat his mom.??The elderly woman had a large map with her, which she used to show Hintz where she was headed. He proceeded to spend the next hour patiently ensuring that she made it there safely, even stopping to push her out of a ditch at one point.

Liberals would probably rather you didn?™t share this story ??it destroys their narrative that all cops are pigs. Therefore, you should definitely share away!

The Boston Police Department's SWAT team has been reunited with its beloved, unofficial mascot.

The department posted on its website that SWAT Cat returned to the unit's home base in the city's Roxbury neighborhood Thursday morning.

The female stray with white, black and light orange fur first started prowling around in 2013, looking for belly rubs and free meals. But she disappeared in late November.

Police feared the worst and even put out an all-points bulletin for the missing feline, posting a shot on Facebook of SWAT Cat lounging on the hood of an armored vehicle.

The department said Thursday that officers are ""just happy that she was safe all this time.""

Days before, Laxamana?™s father Jeff had reportedly punished her for an unspecified transgression by cutting off her hair and uploading a video to YouTube. There?™s now a controversy brewing","Izabel Laxamana, a 13-year-old girl in Tacoma, Washington died by suicide after jumping off a highway overpass on Friday, May 29. Days before, Laxamana?™s father Jeff had reportedly punished her for an unspecified transgression by cutting off her hair and uploading a video to YouTube. There?™s now a controversy brewing online and among the girl?™s friends and family over whether the video caused her death.
Tacoma?™s News Tribune reports that the girl, who they don?™t identify by name, exited a car andjumped off a bridge onto Interstate 5. She was taken to a Seattle hospital, where she died on Saturday. Friends of the Laxamana family are now raising money for funeral costs on a GoFundMe site.
The original 15-second video that is supposedly of Izabel, filmed by her father, has been removed. But one of Laxamana?™s friends shared it by taping the original on his phone:

The video opens with a shot of a short-haired girl in a black t-shirt staring blankly at the camera, in what appears to be a garage.
?œThe consequences of getting messed up, man, you lost all that beautiful hair,??a male voice can be heard saying from behind the camera. The video pans down, where long locks of black hair are scattered on the ground. ?œWas it worth it????œNo,??she responds quietly.
?œHow many times did I warn you???he asks.
?œA lot,??she replies, barely audibly.
After Izabel?™s death, a blog called Tacoma Stories claimed that the public shaming led to her suicide and constituted abuse:

Public shaming is a form of abuse. There are those who will say that it teaches a lesson. So does punching someone in the face. That doesn?™t make it okay to do to your children. My thoughts are with this young girl. I hope that she gets the help she needs. I also hope her father gets the help he so clearly needs and that her family can heal from these traumatic events brought on by public shaming.

The blog?™s author, John Cameron, added in an update that he?™d closed the comments section ?œdue to multiple requests from family members of the victim.??A Facebook page called Justice for Izabel is filled with calls for her father to be criminally prosecuted or else publicly shamed himself.
While the social media mob is busy coming for Laxamana?™s family, it?™s also important to note that determining cause and effect when it comes to suicide isn?™t easy. We have little information about what else was going on in Laxamana?™s life, although in a Google Plus post from last year, she writes about feeling bullied at school. She shares a link to a song and says it?™s what gets her through her tough times:

I feel hated most of the time im in school i feel looked down on and i get judged alot?? But what keeps me going is people like kian who have gone through the same thing as me??In a school with so many people its weird to say ?œi feel alone??but the truth is that you really do feel alone. So thanks for everything kian??

Outside Giaudrone Middle School, someone else filmed the enormous pile of flowers, stuffed animals and chalk messages that have been left by students in tribute to Laxamana:

The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If you?™re in crisis or feeling suicidal, please call 1-800-273-8255. You can also chat online with someone from NSPL at any time, day or night.

It?™s a degrading and thoughtless error that boils away my identity and simplifies me as one thing: ?œthat Asian.??One reason is that our society has so few Asians and people of color in positions of prominence that some people have little exposure to them. Diversity is so lacking in film and television that a director thinks it?™s okay to cast a white person as Chinese, as Cameron Crowe did with Emma Stone in ?œAloha,??and the Hollywood Reporter mistakes ?œMaster of None??actor Kelvin Yu for show co-creator Alan Yang, who tweeted in response, ?œSame race, different dude.??

People look at us without really seeing us. Instead, they simply see our race.

This phenomenon has a name ??psychologists call it the ?œcross-race effect,??a well-replicated finding that people are better at telling apart faces of their own race than those of another race. It becomes an even bigger problem in court: Witnesses are more likely to misidentify an alleged perpetrator of another race. Sixty-six of 216 wrongful convictions overturned by DNA testing involved the use of cross-racial eyewitness identifications, according to the Innocence Project. And white participants in one study were significantly more likely to experience a cross-race effect than black participants.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In this newest chapter of the fiasco which has become the Democratic Primary, Hillary Clinton has offically doomed her campaign. It?™s aside from the blantant lies she has misguided the American people with. It?™s aside from the Benghazi and Clinton Foundation allegations, among other scandals which have plagued her campaign. It?™s even aside from the false accusations that Bernie?™s supporters are violent crowds threatening the entire party. Furthermore, the total lack of respect Hillary has displayed to millions of American voters nation wide, by essentially remarking their votes no longer matter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It goes further than that, particularly towards the constant facts that she is rapidly fading in the polls to a man whom is running a hate campaign. The American people are only getting more and more outraged everytime she opens her mouth. Safe to say, the more she talks, seeing as the media is still trying to do a blackout on the masses the Sanders campaign is gathering.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The actions of Hillary Clinton are similar to those of a child who is desperate to end a game of chess due to time constraints, while their opponent has positioned their pieces well to take the victory. The complete lack of respect from a candidate who is campaigning for votes, but essentially telling millions of voters in NJ, ND, SD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are three main factors which have all but sealed Hillary?™s loss:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Half the Democratic Party has been alienated due to the actions of the DNC and Wasserman-Schultz, along with the media ignoring Bernie Sanders and spreading lies about violence. That number is only growing. The #BernieOrBust movement is real, thousands of registered Democrats will not vote for her. The people have made this completely clear,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Second, Trump does better than Hillary in every poll and is only improving while she gets worse. He has also been a bit more quiet recently, which might be working his benefit. Bernie on the other hand gets wider margins with Trump, Sanders is steadily improving.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Third, there are over 40% of the registered voters in this country listed as Independents. Independents do not do well with Hillary at all, in fact, Hillary has ?œwon??all closed primaries in the country where independents can?™t vote in the primary aside from Oregon. Kentucky has had complaints of voter fraud, and she barely won that too. She?™s been doing worse and worse in the primaries and the cheating is becoming more and more evident.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Meanwhile, the more hot air escapes from the media and Clinton campaign, the more loyal Sanders supporters are. Donations are pouring in as Sanders supporters are continuing to aggressively fund his campaign due to the agitation caused by the Clinton camp. In one day in May alone, and many supporters have stated their goal is a fifty million month. Let?™s not forget, this is the same campaign which raised upwards of forty million in a month fairly recently,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The people have spoken, they do not want Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. Her chances of this, regardless of what she says, for Hillary Clinton, it is too late. Her campaign has taken too much damage from Trump and herself,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Nashville Fraternal Order of Police has advised its members to not voluntarily work at a BeyoncÃ© concert scheduled for Nashville's Nissan Stadium in May.

Nashville's union for police officers outlined that position in a statement released on Friday as FOP chapters in other cities have taken even sharper stands against BeyoncÃ© concerts slated for the pop megastar's upcoming tour.

Sgt. Danny Hale, president of the Nashville Fraternal Order of Police, the Andrew Jackson Lodge #5, said his organization's stance isn't the same as telling officers to outright boycott providing security at the show if they are ordered.

Instead, he said rank-and-file Nashville police officers shouldn?™t volunteer to sign up to work the event.

?œIt?™s pretty obvious there?™s an anti-policing sentiment in her messages,??Hale said, pointing to BeyoncÃ©'s recent halftime show at the Super Bowl earlier this month, which had imagery that critics say is associated with the Black Panther Party.

Hale went on to allege that Black Panther members have been responsible for the deaths of police officers in the past.

?œIf we volunteer to work her event, we?™re basically saying you can say or do anything you want to when it comes to police officers and we?™re just going to sit and take it,??Hale said. ?œWe?™ve been under attack for the past eight, 10, 12 months. Some things that are done and said are just not fair, and it?™s not right.

""All lives matter, including law enforcement officers and citizens, no matter their race.""

Metro Nashville Police Chief Steve Anderson, in a statement issued Friday afternoon, said that police will staff the concert and that public safety requires the police department to staff major events in Nashville.

""The public safety/public service mission of the police department must rise above anyone's personal views concerning a performer,"" Anderson said.

He said a routine special events staffing notice was sent out Friday for BeyoncÃ©'s concert and that the traffic plan for Nissan Stadium and the surrounding area requires about approximately 88 officers. Officers interested in working the assignment have until the close of business on April 15 to respond.

Anderson also said that, as is usual, if there are not adequate numbers of volunteers, some officers will be mandated to fill the vacancies for the weeknight concert.

He said officers working traffic plan assignments will manage the flow of vehicles leaving downtown during rush hour and coming into downtown for the concert.

BeyoncÃ©'s May 5 Nashville concert at Nissan Stadium was announced the day after the Super Bowl as part of her Formation World Tour.

To accompany her live halftime performance, BeyoncÃ© released a music video that attempts to shed light on black victims of police violence while referencing past episodes of racism in America. Critics have argued the video is an attack on police.

The position of Nashville?™s FOP comes as members of both the Miami and Tampa chapters have voted to boycott upcoming BeyoncÃ© shows those cities this spring.

With Nashville's FOP weighing in as well, BeyoncÃ© has now twice been cited by Middle Tennessee law enforcement officials this week.

Rutherford County Sheriff Robert Arnold suggested that BeyoncÃ©'s halftime performance might have inspired someone to shoot inside his home Monday night. Police are still investigating who was responsible.

Nashville's FOP represents 1,600 full-time and retired full-time officers.

That came as the event triggered protests in other cities that turned into clashes with police.

31160214090,ABC7NY,31160214090_10153296450254091,Bill Ritter,"Rev. Al Sharpton meets with slain NYPD Officer Randolph Holder's family, agrees to speak at funeral: http://7ny.tv/1kJ4vOe","every once in a while, there's an opportunity that presents itself.. to make a difference. 

for Reverend Al Sharpton, that opportunity is this wednesday, when he speaks  at the funeral for NYPD officer Randoph Holder, murdered last week after a gang shootout in east harlem. 

Sharpton, a long time critic of the police, was asked by the family to speak at their son's funeral. and so the veteran activist has the unique opportunity, with thousands of cops from around the country in attendance, to reach a new detente in what has been a  terrible and violent 18 months of tension between the police and the community.

i have not talked to sharpton, so i don't know what he has in mind, but if he asked me i'd say he has the opportunity to forge a new kind of peace and a new kind of relationship.  it is time for the violence to stop... for police not to be viewed as the enemy in the community, but as members of the community, with the same goals as moms and dads - to keep the streets safe for all of our kids.  

I'd tell him he's the one to make the case, because so many members of the community listen to him. 

I'd tell him he could talk about it being high-time for high-crime, high-risk communities to take it upon themselves to help prevent the madness of gun violence that has taken so many young lives.  I'd tell him it's time to start lobbying for the high school drop-out age to be raised to 18, because allowing kids to drop out at 16 leads primarily  to jobs at fast food joints or to prison. 

Rev. Al is the man to do this like some historians say the staunchly anti-communist richard nixon was the president to open relations with china in the early 70s.  

i'm pretty sure Sharpton knows this is an important eulogy - and, while his statements about officer holder's death have been respectful and on-point, this speech at the officer's funeral offers a pivotal launching pad to help take all of us in a new direction.  A direction away from the madness that is a gun.. the madness that comes from the epidemic of gun violence. 

It doesn't matter whether this happens under the mantra ""black lives matter"" or ""all lives matter.""  Officer Holder was, after all, black. And his life mattered.  What matters is that Sharpton is standing at a crucial point in history, and what he says on  Wednesday at Holder's funeral will matter. 

Or not. 

I'm hoping it does.",26/10/2015 00:00,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The point isn't to disparage African Americans, but to give added data for our discussion on police killings. Indeed, I believe this shows once again that the 2:1 ratio of blacks to whites killed by police is not indicative of racial bias, but of the significantly higher rate at which blacks commit crimes.

And, no, I am not condoning these killings in any way, merely saying that the disparity in police violence is likely a problem linked to crime, not to race.

Hating Trump is the New Black
 
By Stuart Schwartz Be cool: Hate Donald Trump. It seems that everyone who is anyone these days hates Donald Trump. Mention his name ??or chalk it on a sidewalk ??and our elites break out the smelling salts, pull up their fainting couches, and ??just to make sure all bases are covered ??ring themselves with garlic. Hating The Donald is the equivalent of black in the fashion industry: it goes well on all occasions, whether a formal cocktail party in Washington D.C., a conservative cruise to Alaska (where the basic but stylish Hate Trump is accessorized with awith a colorful touch of Ridicule Palin), or a casual gathering at the Harvard Faculty Club (I was just there, and Trump hate was de rigueur for faculty).

The more he wins, the more they scream. Left and right, politician and journalist, entertainer and educator, the mere mention of The Donald is enough to cause grown men and women to fall down, calling for therapists and instituting ?œsafe spaces????the new liberal craze of creating speech zones where only politically correct opinions can be voiced. No space for Trump in places where men are not men, women are not women, and everyone lives in transgendered faux-harmony.

But, at the same time, those of us who are no one, the jus??folks who simply live and love and work, have come to this realization: Donald Trump is the only national figure of stature willing to fight the politically incorrect fight for those of us who are grateful for country, culture, and opportunity against those with power, privilege, and a thirst for control over our lives??in other words, our enemies.

Enemies? Isn?™t that a bit harsh? No ??how else would you describe a political and cultural elite that arrogantly ignores the desires of the vast majority of U.S. citizens, disparaging their gratitude for blessings rooted in Judeo-Christian culture in general and the United States in particular. Enemies: those who have established a tradition of government incompetence, greed, and ever-increasing regulation of the rest of us. Enemies: the educators and journalistic elites who have taught our children that grievances are good, self-reliance is bad, and authoritarianism is awesome??as long as you consider yourself a citizen of the world and express (but not necessarily believe in) politically correct intentions.

?œMake America great again??is the Trump campaign tagline originally used by Ronald Reagan in his first campaign for the presidency. It precisely captures the need to fight the decay and incompetence that has overtaken our once-vibrant blue states and cities, and now threatens the rest of the country. Swap ?œAmerica??in the slogan with any city or state losing population and jobs while facing increased crime, and you have in a single sentence the Trump remedy for what ails us. Make New York great again. Make California great again. Make Detroit great again. Make education great again. How? Simple: Recognize that what we?™re doing doesn?™t work, and confront the suicidal attitudes, corruption, and incompetence on display by our political and educational elites. Donald Trump is doing the same thing at a national level that we do around dinner tables ??state the obvious and answer with common sense.

Left and right, they scream and whine. But The Donald thinks for himself, a successful businessman with an uncanny ability to be sensibly blunt. Illegal immigration? Think about its effect on the everyday and law-abiding??and fuggedaboutit. Those thugs trying to kill us are screaming ?œAllahu Akbar!??  Hey, they?™re not Christians, Jews, or even members of the First International Church of Jediism; they are Muslims?¦so take a deep breath, roll up the welcome mat for a bit and come up with an immigration policy saner than turning American citizens into roadkill. Industries comprising the core of our economy leaving the United States? Take a look at our trade, tax, and regulatory policies??and put this nation and its citizens first.

Chancellor Jerry Falwell Jr. of Liberty University, an early and emphatic Trump supporter, put it this way: ?œWe need someone to bring this country back from the brink and make America great again.??The Donald, he explained, promises to be ?œa citizen legislator who is a tough negotiator??a businessman who has built companies from the ground up, and who will use those experiences to be tough with China, ISIS and nations that are taking advantage of the United States by stealing our jobs??(Full disclosure: I?™m on the faculty at Liberty where we educate students for a life of thinking and doing stuff, not whining).

And, of course, the Washington Post ??seeking to create a safe space for Beltway elites ??responded to Falwell by getting a church staffer to call for the Baptist church to throw Falwell out because he has actively campaigned for Trump, a man who ?œoozes evil.??Left, right or Washington religious, they tell Trump supporters to shut up and let your betters run things. Or, as that journalistic mainstay of the left, Salon put it: ?œAmerica, you?™re stupid?? a nation of idiots.??So shut up. And on the right, while the politics are different, the message and attitude is the same. The still-respected but now increasingly strident National Review put it in their front page middle finger to Trump supporters: Hey, you largely live in communities that ?œdeserve to die.??So shut up.

And so both ends of the spectrum train their rhetorical guns on Trump. But he?™s having none of it, pushing back in his inimitable Queens/New York City style, talking truth and common sense to the elites that have spent the past half century floating to the top of our society. He?™s a racist. He?™s a homophobe. He?™s anti-Christian. He?™s Islamaphobic. He?™s Hitler. He?™s Mussolini. He?™s the barbarian at the gate, the serial killer at the screen door, the leader of jackbooted millions marching to the voting booth?¦Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump.

All of which is why, in my first primary vote evah, I chose Trump. How could I not? I?™m told that a vote for The Donald is as good as good as admitting that you?™re a racist homophobe who has taken a barrel too many stupid pills.",,21/04/2016 00:00,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He has also enlisted fellow adventurers to appear in his photos, with one showing diver Dinah Halstead surrounded by a circle of barracuda in Papua New Guinea.

?˜Sometimes you?™re using six or seven strobes or large surface-powered HMI movie lights.??One picture shows a male tomato clownfish guarding his clutch of developing eggs in the Philippines, while another captures a weedy sea dragon patrolling a Tasmanian kelp forest.
Mr Doubilet said: ?˜There are always moments that are dangerous. I wouldn?™t say I have ever been scared as such but I can?™t deny I have certainly put myself in many dangerous situations.

With the Presidential candidates pretty much settled at this point (right? ??right?) it is now time to organize an infinite number of electrons in the old and new media to make stunningly wrong predictions on the possibilities for Vice-Presidential picks for each candidate. In this edition, we?™ll discuss the options available to the Once and Future Inevitable Next President of the United States, First Lady/Senator/Secretary Hillary! Rodham Clinton, noted IT and National Security expert. First, let?™s consider what Her Clintonic Majesty may be looking for in a running mate. To start off with, the Washington Post has put together a long list of 27 possibilities for the position. Some of them I find to be fanciful (Al Franken? Al Franken? Al F?™n Franken?), so I narrowed that down to a top ten that we can analyze. I?™ve thought about it for nearly four minutes now, and I think it boils down to the following criteria in the following order of importance:

1. Unwavering Loyalty: Hillary!?™s entire career is one long exercise in demanding fealty and subservience from those who work on her behalf, and I don?™t see that changing once she reaches the pinnacle of public life. This works against some noted former rivals (Sanders) as well as other Democrats who enjoy a high level of popularity (Warren). HRC would want a VP who absolutely depends on the Clinton Machine and won?™t make any public challenges to her agenda. Furthermore, I think she is narcissistic and paranoid enough that she will not brook any private dissent either. This augurs well for someone like Martin O?™Malley, who pointedly declined to criticize her questionable ethics during his brief primary run, or a Senate ally like Amy Klobuchar.

2. Comfortable as a Second Fiddle: While her husband was willing to pick an ambitious, preening, camera-loving egomaniac as his VP, don?™t expect the same from HRC. As the first female President, she will want to spotlight to be solely upon her. This is another strike against Warren, and is definitely a weak spot to other charismatic media-savvy politicians like Cory Booker and Deval Patrick.

3. Credible in Role: I think this might be a criteria forced upon HRC by circumstances. She may feel confident that the FBI investigation into her illegal use of personal email will go nowhere, but it sure seems that many Democrats are rightfully skittish that an indictment could derail her candidacy. It is imperative, therefore, that the VP nominee be someone who independent voters would trust as a credible leader who could step into the Presidency at a moment?™s notice. I am not an independent voter, so I have no idea how they would rank the various candidates. I think an ex-governor like O?™Malley would have some credibility, and perhaps Warren, Kaine, Bayh, and Klobuchar would be deemed acceptable. Deval Patrick left Massachusetts in pretty bad shape when he left the governor?™s office, and then he embroiled himself in a scandal concerning Boston?™s aborted bid for the 2024 Olympics, which should cause him problems on the campaign trail. The major two Latino candidates, Perez and Castro, are both far less prepared for executive office than Sarah Palin was in 2008.

4. Appeases Sanderistas: The devoted followers of Senator Bernard Sanders, an elderly white socialist from un-diverse Vermont, may think that this ought to be HRC?™s top priority. She needs his supporters to turn out for her in November and she thus can?™t afford any bad blood with him, so though this will not be her major criteria it will be heavily considered. Hillary! is arrogant enough to think she can win over the Bernie Bros and Babes on her own and she thus might feel that she can safely forego offering the VP slot to Sanders or to Elizabeth Warren, another elderly white woman. But look for whomever she selects to at the very least pay lip service to the angry leftist populism that dominated this primary.

5. Suitable to the Diversity Crowd: Normally this would be a much higher priority for the Democrat nominee, but since HRC has the novelty of being the first woman to be a major party candidate for President, she probably feels that the diversity requirement has been fulfilled. Her popularity with black voters also helps insulate her from the demands of the hardcore crybullies, though she will no doubt have to make at least one major concession to the Black Lives Matter crowd somewhere along the way.

So given all that, here is a quick chart showing how each candidate stacks up in each category. I have added question marks in the areas that I think as yet remain unknown.",,09/06/2016 00:00,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1.81135E+11,Law Enforcement Today,181135410243_10157188280470244,Local law enforcement feels the love from community,"Local law enforcement feels the love from community

Two weeks ago, Pasadena Police Department Assistant Chief Josh Brueger was preparing his uniform for work, something he?™s been doing almost every day for nearly 20 years in law enforcement.
But in the last month, something is different about that routine.
A black band - half an inch wide - wraps all the way around the officer?™s badge. Written in Latin, the phrase ?œNo one harms me with impunity??is taken to heart.

?œTo me its symbol of solidarity,??Brueger said.
A symbol of solidarity and often a reminder of loss and sacrifice, the black band becomes a part of the uniform following tragedy.
For the last month, Brueger, like thousands in law enforcement throughout the country, have been wrapping the band around their badges.

Between July 7 and July 17, eight police officers were slain in separate incidents in Dallas and Baton Rouge.
In both cases, the officers were ambushed by assailants.
On that morning two weeks ago, Brueger realized that the band had become part of his everyday ritual.

?œIt was like a private moment where I just sat there thinking and then looked at my badge, and it just struck me that this was the second full week that I?™ve had it on,??he said. ?œI can?™t remember another time in my career that we?™ve worn the band that long.??
It was also the first time, Brueger said, that his wife feared for his safety for reasons apart from being on the street or on patrol.
?œThe men and women out on the front lines answering the calls, they understand that you could go out to a domestic disturbance or making a traffic stop and having something happen to you,??he said. ?œThe difference now is that people are targeted just for wearing the uniform.??
The community has demonstrated support in the wake of Dallas and Baton Rouge: with letters, by bringing food or by simply greeting them in restaurants and other public places to express their gratitude.

It can be easy as a police officer, Brueger said, to feel embattled.
?œPeople don?™t generally interact with police unless you?™re making a traffic stop or dealing with a suspect, so when you?™re dealing with negativity day in and day out and then turn on the TV and see these attacks, it can seem like the whole world is against you,??he said. ?œThe silver lining of this is the reminder that the vast majority, especially in Pasadena, support law enforcement.??
In Kemah, citizens have been similarly responsive. Children have sent letters and citizens have gone out of their way to thank officers. One man parked his truck at the fire department with a sign that read, ?œPolice Lives Matter??and held a Thin Blue Line in tribute to the fallen in Dallas and Baton Rouge and out of respect to law enforcement in the community.
?œHe stood in the pouring rain the following day and did it again,??said Kemah Police Department Sgt. Jerry Barmore ?œIt?™s unfortunate that we have to have something bad happen in law enforcement to realize what kind of support we have, but the support through these tragic events has been amazing.??It?™s been refreshing, Brueger said, for people to walk up and offer to buy a cup of coffee, to offer lunch.
?œIt?™s good because police need that reminder that it?™s only a small a minority that is anti-law enforcement,??he said. ?œIf there is a positive to come out of this, these reminders have been great.??Safety has become a heightened sense of urgency. Some departments are providing officers the option of riding two in a patrol car.
It?™s important for the morale of officers, Brueger said, not to become bitter and angry.
?œThat is the challenge,??he said. ?œObviously we want our guys to be safe, we want our guys to be aware. The big thing is to remind the line-level folks that the vast majority support the police.??Seabrook police recently responded to an incident involving a suicide. Family members had four pizzas delivered to the department as a thank you to the responding officers for the professionalism and compassion they showed during a personal tragedy. While all the expressions of support are meaningful, that one hit close to the heart.
?œAs a supervisor, I help with the training and it makes me feel good as a trainer to know that our officers are doing the best job they can every day,??said Barmore. ?œThe way we treat citizens is of utmost importance to us. A lot of times you just wonder how much support you have ?¦the volume of the support we?™ve received during this time is unbelievable. It feels good. In a small community, the citizens are almost like family how people are coming up here and treating us.??The black band has also become a gut-check on how the deep the bond goes among law enforcement and how strong their commitment is to service.
?œWe don?™t want this to create a divide between the police and the 90 percent of the citizens that still support us,??Brueger said. ?œThe band means that no one harms us without provocation, and we all stand together. We all signed up, we all took an oath to serve and protect and we all stand together and when something happens to one of us it happens to all of us.??

It's really not hard to understand why some Americans support Donald J. Trump.

For the past seven years the citizens of the United States have been witness to the following:

( 1 ) Intense verbal attacks on police officers, labeling them racists who hunt down young black men.

( 2 ) A porous southern border where narcotics and people smuggling continue unabated.

( 3 ) A stagnant economy where workers have little bargaining power.

( 4 ) A growing jihadist terror threat that the Democratic Party refuses to define, not even using the words 'Islamic terrorism.'

( 5 ) A Democratic president who after he announces the beheading of an American citizen by ISIS goes out to play golf.

( 6 ) A culture that now demands political correctness, even if it goes against sincerely held religious beliefs.

( 7 ) A legal system that may harm a business owner if he or she does not want to participate in a gay marriage or Catholic nuns who do not want to distribute birth control.

( 8 ) A press corps that generally embraces liberalism, using its constitutional privilege to diminish non-liberals who have the intestinal fortitude to speak out.

( 9 ) An educational system dominated by leftist teachers and administrators who often impose their views on defenseless children.

(10) And a grievance industry that is often promoted by the media, thus allowing anti-American zealots to define this country as evil and oppressive, i.e. America is the real problem in the world.

In the face of all that an avenger named Donald J.Trump has risen, promising to stop the madness and giving a blunt voice to millions of angry Americans.

The movement that Trump represents has nothing to do with fascism, but everything to do with furious dissent. We know for a fact that some very bad people are trying to exploit his campaign to disguise racial and social hatred.

The cold truth is charges of racism and fascism are easy smears designed to stop freedom of expression and stifle debate.

Here's more truth: 
The USA turned for the worse long before Donald J. Trump ever entered the political arena!!

1.81135E+11,Law Enforcement Today,181135410243_10156977324430244,Law enforcement runners carry Special Olympics torch,"Law enforcement runners carry Special Olympics torch

Law enforcement members and Special Olympics athletes ran side by side through downtown Ithaca on Wednesday, carrying the ""Flame of Hope.""

With the annual Law Enforcement Torch Run, the participants were raising awareness and funds for the Special Olympics.

One runner was a local athlete, 16-year-old Kinsey Henry, of Groton, who will compete in the Special Olympics 2017 Winter World Games in Austria. She will represent Team USA in snowshoeing. While catching her breath at Stewart Park, where the three-mile run ended, Henry said she is excited to compete next year and is thankful for all the support around her.

""When all the community comes out and cheers for us, it just makes me feel good and actually have people support us, like we're doing something good for the community and for Special Olympics,"" she said.

Competing in the Winter World Games will be Henry's first time out of the U.S. She said she's nervous but excited.

""Thank you to everyone who came out and cheered for us,"" Henry said.

Henry will be joined in Austria by Trooper Neil Case, of the New York State Police, who will be running Law Enforcement Torch Runs in various cities across Austria next year.

""Everybody has a lot to learn from these athletes,"" Case said. ""The amount of dedication they put in toward their events and the sportsmanship they display is just unbelievable.""

Case has been the Southern Tier regional director for the torch run since 2012. He got involved after coordinating safety for Polar Plunges, since he is in charge of the dive team. Case said he also has an 8-year-old son with Down syndrome. ""As I got more involved, this became more special to me,"" Case said.

Sgt. Barry Banfield, of the Ithaca Police Department, said local law enforcement was well represented Wednesday. About 70 people participated in total. Members of the IPD, state police, park police, as well as Cayuga Heights, Cornell University and Ithaca College police departments, donned black torch run T-shirts and ran. About 16 Special Olympics athletes took part in Wednesday's run.

There were about twice as many participants this year than in 2015, Banfield estimated. The boost in participation might be attributed to the fact that last year's run was 12 miles up to Taughannock Falls.

Though clouds were overhead during the event Wednesday afternoon, the rain held off until the runners arrived at Stewart Park, where they were greeted by friends and family, a barbecue and music.

Wednesday's run came just ahead of the 2016 Special Olympics New York Summer Games, which will take place Friday through Sunday at SUNY Brockport. More than 1,700 Special Olympics New York athletes, coaches and volunteers will take part. Competitions include basketball, volleyball, track and field, tennis, bowling, gymnastics, aquatics and powerlifting.

Last year, the Law Enforcement Torch Run programs raised nearly $2 million statewide, and globally, more than $51 million was raised. The run is now in its 30th year in New York.

Cassandra Rucker, director of development for the Special Olympics Central Region and Southern Tier, said the run is a two-way support system.

""When you think about law enforcement and them feeling supported by the community, our athletes love them. They're superheroes. They're real, live superheroes,"" Rucker said. ""But when it comes to Special Olympics, they just look up to each other so much.""

Members of law enforcement always give the athletes awards, Rucker said, which is ""everything"" to the athletes. ""That's Justin Bieber; that's any celebrity putting that medal around their neck and saying, 'You matter and you count,' and it goes both ways,"" Rucker said.

Special Olympics is the largest amateur sports organization in the world, with 67,000 athletes, according to a news release. Special Olympics New York is the largest chapter in North America and the sixth-largest chapter in the world. Special Olympics New York athletes train and compete year-round in 22 sports, at no cost to the athlete, their families or caregivers.

Every year, more than 85,000 law enforcement officers participate in the torch run throughout 46 nations, 12 Canadian provinces and 50 states, raising more than $51 million for local Special Olympics programs in 2014 and over $560 million since its inception in 1981, a news release said.

Case said it is important for the community to be aware of Special Olympics athletes.

He said he ran the entire run with Henry, who said she had to get a ride last year. ""She said her goal this year was to run or walk the entire thing, which she did,"" Case said. ""She said that was her goal, and to see her push through and finish the race like she did was awesome.""

""These athletes are very inspirational. They all work hard,"" Case said.

And now, just in the nick of time, a new ""non-specific"" level of PFH from the Dept. of Homeland (In)Security.  At his We Meant Well website, TomDispatch regular and State Department whistleblower Peter Van Buren does a superb job of catching the PFH of it all.  Here's his piece.  Tom

""For us old-timers, memories of those post-9/11 days persist like that rotting squirrel stuck somewhere under your back porch.

""One of the features of those dirty days was the panic index, actually called the terrorism alert system, created by the then-new Department of Homeland Security. The system featured a five-step, color-coded ?œalert level??ranging from black (normal) to red (attack imminent.) The system was criticized for doing little more than promoting a constant background hum of anxiety when it basically got stuck at ?œelevated risk??for nearly eight years.

""The Obama administration, in 2010, replaced the old five step system with a new two step one: imminent and elevated. It too got stuck in elevated mode and faded into obscurity. Most people today don?™t even know it exists.

""That is now over. Following the events of San Bernardino, the Department of Homeland Security announced this week that a new level will be added to cover less serious threats, though officials declined to say what it will be called. ?œIt wouldn?™t be specifics like time and place,??one of the officials said. ?œIt would be along the lines of terrorists have expressed interest in attacking this type of target.??
""The new system sounds suspiciously like the State Department travel advisory system. Originally created to send out bulletins on immediate dangers affecting travelers (?œflood in Mali??, the system quickly morphed into a steady stream of ?œworld-wide??generalities along the lines of ?œsomething terrorist may happen somewhere sometime, so better just stay home.??
""The new Homeland Security warning system will by definition add a new threat layer that is unspecific. That raises the point of what is the point. The media already is doing a fine job of stoking the public?™s fear levels via a steady stream of exaggerated reports on ISIS (replacing the old steady stream of exaggerated reports on al Qaeda, could be a pattern here.) The result is quite clearly of value only in keeping alive among a gullible public anxiety and fear.

""And so the new warning system will enter the media-government feedback loop as follows. Homeland Security will issue a non-specific warning of ?œsomething terrorist may happen somewhere sometime.??The media will then dutifully report that warning, amplifying its pointlessness across TV, the last few newspapers and the web. Pundits will pick up the media reports and comment on them, keeping alive for another few news cycles a non-story that should never have been taken seriously in the first place.

""The result: Panic. Anxiety. Fear. Public support for further erosion of our civil rights and freedoms because we will have to ?œdo something??in response to the new threat. Repeat, and repeat.""

Every single time an African-American is killed by police, we begin seeing every mistake they've ever made all over the media.

Within hours, if a mugshot is available, we begin seeing it spread like wildfire all over the internet ??as if the presence of a mugshot alone somehow justifies the brutal execution of men like Alton Sterling in Louisiana or Philando Castile in Minnesota.

Every traffic ticket Castile has ever received has been scrutinized. This isn't new. In spite of videos showing just how brutal and unnecessary the deaths of so many black victims of police brutality are, like clockwork, we learn how they stole from Wal-Mart in March of 1999 or got caught with marijuana in February of 2003 or had an expired license seven years ago. It's ridiculous.

It's extremely doubtful that the same thing would happen to many beloved white figures, whose criminal pasts are all but irrelevant.

Tim Allen, who not only starred in the family sitcom ""Home Improvement"" for eight years, but is widely known as the voice of Buzz Lightyear in ?œToy Story,??spent two and a half years in prison for cocaine possession. If a police officer killed him today, do you think we'd see his mugshot going viral? Do you think his criminal past would be the primary focus of conservatives or white supremacists?

Mark Wahlberg was once charged with attempted murder. He beat two immigrants so badly with a wooden stick that he left one of them blind in one eye. He was able to take a plea deal for assault and was sentenced to two years in prison. Have you ever seen his mugshot? If he got killed tomorrow, do you think his rap sheet would be blamed for it all? Would his mugshot be in his obituary?

Christian Slater's career has had a bit of a resurgence because of his starring role in the new hit show, ?œMr. Robot.??Did you even know he had an extensive criminal record? Have you ever seen his mugshots? He was arrested back in 1989 for drunk driving. In 1997 he was arrested for assaulting his girlfriend. Later that year he was arrested for trying to take a gun on a plane. In 2005 he was arrested for sexual assault. None of this has held him back and it's doubtful any of it would have featured prominently if he died tomorrow.

I'm a huge Robert Downey Jr. fan. My whole family loves him in ?œIron Man.??He was arrested in 1996 with cocaine, heroin and a loaded gun. Similar drug charges came in 2000 and again in 2001. He was sentenced to three in years in prison. Is this what we talk about when we talk about Tony Stark? Of course not!

The year after ?œFerris Bueller??came out, Matthew Broderick was charged with reckless driving in an accident where he crossed into incoming traffic and killed both of the passengers in the vehicle he hit head-on. Had you even heard of that before? I hadn't.

I'm glad that all of these men have been given second and third chances at life. I'm glad that Robert Downey Jr. was pardoned for his felony drug conviction. I'm glad that all of these men are known for the best of who they are, not the worst. That's fair. That's how life should be, but that's simply not the story for so many African-American victims of police brutality who end up being dragged through the mud with mugshots and criminal histories taking primary roles in their storylines.

These men and women end up being known for their lowest moments in life. It's a double standard fueled by white privilege.

While money and fame may indeed be central to why these men have been able to overcome their criminal pasts, and not be defined by them, race no doubt plays a central role in why black victims of police brutality get no break whatsoever in how they are most often portrayed by the media.

For years I have posted topics ranging from political news and social injustices to relationships and sex. These topics reflect my range of interest. Like many of you I'm open to difference belief systems, different cultures, travel, and learning from different points of view.

But lately I've noticed that too many of my Facebook family feels the need to interject race and religion into every topic while others go out of their way to express how much they don't like a particular topic. Instead of offering a better argument they insult and bully people because they lack the information or aptitude to engage in a civil debate. To those people I say this, ""Your presence is not welcome on Michael Baisden Live and it's time to clean house...again!

The only way we're going to grow and continue to promote intelligent dialogue is to block those whose only interest is to be contrary to every subject and to insult others because they don't see the world the same way. And worse of all they attack those of a different race or religious belief, or non belief. 
It may be a free country but membership on this page has a cost and that's respect. I will not allow those negative people to use my platform to promote hate and ignorance. 

Whites, Hispanics, Asians are all apart of my FB family as well as my cool black family who enjoy a good debate. And by the way, so are gays, the transgender community and Swingers. This is an adult page for free thinkers not for people stuck in a box. 

So, I'm serving notice that whoever attacks another person based on race, religion, lifestyle, or sexual orientation will be blocked. I have exciting plans for this page and now that we're rolling again it's time to kick some of these closed minded asses off the page so the rest of us can get down with some real conversation, live podcast, and meet and greets. 

Let's get this party started! ~ Michael Baisden

Has, like many desperate publications in print media, become a regurgitation of elitist propaganda.

So, It comes as no surprise that Newsweek would produce an article of arrogant swill such as this. ??Star Wars??Class Wars: Is Mars the Escape Hatch for the 1 Percent???By Kevin Maney.  Maney states for all of our simple little shrunken minds that ?œWhile many dream of escaping earth to settle on Mars, billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are working to make it possible. But finding a new home on the red planet will likely only be for the rich, leaving the poor to suffer as earth's environment collapses and conflict breaks out.??

Well good riddance super rich. If you need help packing there are millions of Americans that would be happy to oblige. Earth is in turmoil because of the super rich. Not the average citizen working 9 to 5. Unyielding war, Race division Propaganda, Centralized banking systems, mega corporations raking in huge profits while destroying the middle class, Carbon tax madness regulated in the name of phony climate science, and terrorists funded by a black budget so the elite can win at their global board game of RISK.  Not to mention the protected heroin industry, disappearing children and sex slave trade as a result of the Luciferian doctrine many of the elite openly subscribe to.  

Plus, your Frankenstein monster ISIS would be left holding the bag if you rocketed off to another planet. Trust me, ISIS doesn?™t want to deal with 300 plus million angry Americans, that threat would be gone in a heartbeat. And please save a seat for everyone in Congress.  With those idiots gone, and our Constitution and rights fully adhered to and represented, we would plot a course for thousands of years of happiness, prosperity and liberty.
 
Maney continues ?œThis is the unspoken flip side of Musk?™s SpaceX and Bezos?™s Blue Origin. The space travel companies say they are creating a way for the human species to endure by populating other planets. But the bottom line is that only the wealthy will have the means to move to Mars. Musk?™s target ticket price is $500,000 a person in 2015 dollars, and that?™s just to get there. Imagine the new outfits you?™ll have to buy to go with that space helmet.??

So when?™s your flight?

Two groups of demonstrators, one supporting and the other protesting the police, faced off on Friday night in McKinney, Texas ??and violence nearly erupted. One group waved ?œblack lives matter??signs while the other owned the slogan ?œback the blue.??
While local news reports mostly focused on the conflict, there was one positive moment that drastically stood out.
As anger brewed among the dueling protests, a black man protesting police brutality and a white man supporting the police unexpectedly came together to discuss their differences in a civil manner. The two men held hands, hugged and prayed together, KDFW-TV reported.
?œThey want to make it a black and white thing, it?™s not a black and white thing,??Lashadion Anthony said. ?œIt?™s a community versus the police that are abusing their power. We?™re not saying that all police are racists and all police are bad, but there are certain police that are abusing their power.??

The other man, identified as Scott Harmaring by KDFW-TV, said the moment made it clear to him that opposing sides can ?œwork together.???œIt means there?™s a chance that we can fix some of the problems in our society today if we?™d all just learn to do what we just did and work together and pray together, there?™s a chance?¦the policeman that created the problem is gone, but that doesn?™t make our whole police department racist,??he added.

Complete with a tiny hijab on her plastic head, the miniature fashionista could not be further away from the blonde doll that has brandished the bedrooms of millions of youngsters for almost 60 years.

The ?˜Hijarbie??was created by 24-year-old Haneefah Adam, from Nigeria, who wanted to create a doll that dressed the way she did.

Her creation came just days after Mattel introduced a more realistic range of Barbie dolls in the biggest shake-up in the 57 year history of the model.

The new line includes four body types ??the original rail-thin Barbie, a taller Barbie, one with more curves and a petite version.

In addition there are seven skin tones, 22 eye colours and a number of hair styles.

The former US President broke from his written remarks to criticize Black Lives Matter protesters who had interrupted him during his speech in Philadelphia.

""I don?™t know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out into the streets to murder other African-American children, maybe you thought they were good citizens, but she didn?™t,"" the former president declared, defending his wife?™s ""superpredator"" comments in 1996.

Melvin Edwards
Being black and Republican is rare, but it?™s not unheard of and I don?™t feel lonely because of those confluent facts alone. The reality for me is that being black and Republican while living in Maryland has been a greater challenge. The politics here are the opposite of Texas??and I can tell you from experience that there?™s no one as intolerant as a liberal who is comfortably in the majority. This state is like a huge college campus with its ?œtenured??elected officials and lack of accountability whose bad ideas lead to predictable outcomes. For my first piece of evidence, I present to you: Baltimore ??a black-majority city that hasn?™t elected a Republican in almost 50 years.


Democrats and liberals in the age of Obama say they value independence and free speech, but that seems to be limited to agreeing with philosophies and ideals that reflect their own views. Try being against trending stances and see if your positions are treated as reasonable alternatives.

Being a black Republican in 2015 can carry ridicule, though normally not physical risk. But who wants to be ridiculed? On the other hand, it can also be a demeaning proposition when proximity alone allows people to collect their racial bona fides by accepting a racial minority as one of their own (i.e. ?œSome of my best friends are?¦â€?, then flaunting it as some kind of an accomplishment.

Black Republicanism is countercultural and individualist. However, individualism is the enemy of collectivism and political correctness.

Alan Keyes, Herman Cain, and Dr. Ben Carson are not equal candidates in the same way that Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio aren?™t, in the same way that Jeb Bush and Scott Walker aren?™t. But lumping together racial likenesses is easier than treating people as individuals when they self-identify as Republicans and you think the ideals espoused by the GOP make your opponent your enemy. And what better way to marginalize your opponent than through ridicule.

The best part about being a black Republican is the assumption that you?™re a Democrat, which allows plenty of fly-on-the-wall opportunities to Democrat conversations. If they don?™t adhere to the adage about assuming making asses, I am not compelled to protect them from them showing theirs.

I recently learned that my paternal grandfather, who died 20 years before I was born, had been drafted into World War I. No solders ever had less to gain from war that black soldiers during WWI. In the Civil War, there was self-preservation and emancipation on the line. In WWII, there was the beginning of the Civil Rights Era and dignity. In World War I, black solders bravely fought internationally for a country that didn?™t recognize their rights back home. Yet, many remained patriotic Americans and many of their descendants are today.

Ignorance of history funnels black voters to Democrat straight-party voting and they would be stunned that until the mid-1960s, most black voters were on the other side of the aisle. Martin Luther King and Jackie Robinson were Republicans. I learned what I know from my parents ??who were both black ??but I have no idea what their political leanings were. They didn?™t talk about them because they couldn?™t talk about them. In the time period that provided their context, black people voting was a radical act in the Jim Crow South, so they voted and kept quiet. Jim Crow laws were Democrat ideas and enforced by members of that party, which is not to say that all Democrats thought that way.

As for me, I vote and also keep quiet. I?™m politically engaged and have even been politically employed, but when I?™m at work now, I never talk politics. In fact, some people who have known me for a decade or more have no idea what my political leanings are unless they ask. Most of them assume I?™m a Democrat, so they feel no need to ask.

Most people like labels because it puts things in easy-to-understand terms for them and simple terms are even better for them. I hate labels because they can represent intellectual laziness and covert racism.

 
In this age of Obama, we are closer to being a color-blind society, but further away from accepting differences. From my vantage point, we are not in a good place.

Cop killer Assata Shakur, formerly known as Joanne Chesimard, murdered New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster in 1973 and then fled to Cuba.

Assata Shakur, a.k.a. Joanne Chesimard is a former(?) Black Panther and Black Liberation Army agitator and cop killer. She has been a fugitive from justice for nearly 40 years and openly thumbs her nose at her victim?™s family while living in Cuba as a political asylee. In 1973, Chesimard shot and killed New Jersey state trooper Werner Foerster execution-style during a traffic stop. She is currently hiding from US authorities in Cuba.
As Officer Foerster lay on the ground wounded and helpless, Shakur grabbed his gun and blasted two shots into his head.

1.12884E+14,Conservatives Against A Liberal Agenda,112883682080346_933380073364032,"FBI: Investigation into murder of Jessica Chambers, Mississippi teen burned alive, yields gun,...","black lives matter, *** , white lives, well, not so very much at all ....

on december 6, 2014 in the state of mississippi jessica chambers was doused in gasoline, and burned alive.   in the last several days a host of blacks have been arrested and charged with various matters unrelated to chambers's death, by way of information gathered during investigation of the murder.  the various arrests deal with drug and gun charges, and related topics under the general heading of thuggery.

you haven't read about it in the national news, nor have you seen it in the national television broadcasts, such as cover this sort of thing.

jessica chambers was 19 years old, a white female, at the date of her death.   those arrested are members of black gangs.   all of them.   jessica chambers associated with them prior to her death, not very intelligent choices of associates. none of them.

that does not begin to describe the bizarre nature of the events.  suffice it to say that persons associated with chambers called for the rape and death of white women.  by burning.--

""one week before, and on just the day before jessica chambers was carjacked and burned to death, certain blacks among her intimate circle and acquaintance were involved in facebook exchanges wherein calls for the rape and burnings of white women and children, especially the families of white police officer, were posted.  

""although not a police officer himself, jessica chambers??father is an employee of the panola county sheriff?™s department, in the vehicle maintenance section.

""[the writer posted] the comment, ?œsomebody need to rape all his kids in front of him then sit(sic) the house on fire an watch them burn??i bet he was a white man SAD??
the writer, self identified as ""SAD"" is sandy rudd, sister of brian rudd who was jessica chambers's one-time boy friend.   the post above at ""clash daily"" details other facts and cirstances associated with jessica chambers's murder, the most damning being that various persons associated with the rudds are seen talking to jessica chambers at a convenience store where she bought gas, and where one of the persons was seen carrying a gas can.  ibid.

go to the link, and read this horrible mess.

the point of this post is that the mainstream media has not made anything of this story in the year since the murder, and in the several days after the arrests of the black persons involved, on other charges, became public.

barak obama has not said that if he had had a white daughter she would have been just like jessica chambers.   jesse jackson has not rushed to mississippi to champion the cause of the dead white girl, nor has he condemned the murderous proclivities of the black gang members who are more than just likely responsible for her death.   nor, has al sharpton stepped forward to castigate black murderers of white women.

you read.

you make up your own mind.","17 suspected gang members were arrested as a result of the investigation into the death of Jessica Chambers, found burned alive more than a year ago",20/12/2015 00:00,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These were the fond memories and lessons Angela took to the grave site with her every day for a week after the funeral. She would stand over her dear mother?™s grave and read letters aloud to express how much she missed her. Each message was filled with deep emotion and heartache. It was Angela?™s way of dealing with the anxiety and pain of losing her number one role model and her best friend. On the last night before she was preparing to leave for Atlanta, Angela locked herself in her mother?™s bedroom and prayed to God for guidance. Bright and early the following morning she wrote her final letter and then went to the grave site to deliver it to her mother.

Dear Mama,

I know you?™re tired of listening to all these sad letters. I?™ve been out here every day in the cold and rain just to read to you and have you all to myself. If I know you, you?™re probably lookÂ­ing down from heaven thinking, ?œThat child has lost her mind.??But the fact is that I miss you, Mama. I miss you so much that sometimes I don?™t think I?™m going to be able to make it. Every day I wake up hoping that all of this is just some kind of horrible dream, and that you?™re going to come into my room and tell me to get my lazy behind out of bed so we can go shopping. For a brief moment I?™m happy, and everything is the way it used to be. But after I get up and go into your empty bedroom, reality sets in; my whole world comes tumbling down around me. When that happens, nothing matters to me: not school, not my career, not even food. Look at me, I?™ve lost nearly fifteen pounds in the last two weeks; and I?™m as thin as a rail. I guess I can finally be a supermodel after all.

I?™m making fun because I woke up this morning with God?™s comforting arms wrapped around me. He told me everything was going to be all right and that it was time for me to get on with my life. That?™s when I sprang out of bed and took inventory of myself. I realized that I am the daughter of Ms. Faye Williams, a strong black woman who went through hell and high water to give her children a chance to make something of themselves in this cold world. I had to check myself, Mama, because you had to endure trials and tribulations ten times worse than death, and you made it. I was first embarrassed and then ashamed of myself for not being stronger for you and for Andre. But I want you to know that I?™m okay now, and with God?™s help I?™m ready to move forward with my life and honor your name. My only wish is that I will grow up to be half the woman that you were. I love you, Mama.

Rest in peace.
Your loving daughter,
Angela

Bishop Jackson: If Planned Parenthood Founder Had Her Way MLK, Rosa Parks Wouldn?™t Have Been Born

The Democrat Party continues to be fierce defenders of Planned Parenthood, an organization founded by a racist White woman who wanted to destroy the Black race. 
Ironically, her wish came true because most abortion centers run by Planned Parenthood are in Black neighborhoods.    

CNS News reports at a press conference outside the National Portrait Gallery on Thursday, Bishop E.W. Jackson said that if Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger had her way Civil Rights Movement leaders Martin Luther King, Jr., and Rosa Parks ""would never have been born.""

The press conference brought together a group of black pastors and pro-life leaders who are demanding that the portrait gallery, which is a part of the federally funded Smithsonian Institution, remove a bust of Margaret Sanger.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Obama administration?™s ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
?œdivide and conquer strategy??may have enabled the president to secure two successive White House victories, but the fallout has been ?œdestructive for America,??Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke said.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Discussing the results of a Fox News poll, in which a majority of respondents said they believe race relations have grown worse under Obama, Sheriff Clarke told Megyn Kelly he blamed the president for fanning the flames of racial division in the wake of controversial grand jury decisions in Ferguson and Staten Island. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
?œHe built that, and he being the President of the United States,??Sheriff Clarke told Kelly. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
???œRemember that statement, ?˜You didn?™t build that???,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Well, he built this racial divide. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It was a wound that had been healing for a number of years, a number of decades I should say. And he reopened it with his divisive politics.??,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
?œâ€¦President Obama has benefited from the divide and conquer strategy and has secured two successive electoral victories for the White House, but it?™s been very destructive for America,??Sheriff Clarke stated.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The outspoken law enforcement official went on to say Obama could have had a ?œGettysburg address moment,??but instead fumbled the opportunity by focusing on demonizing police forces and by harping on racial tensions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
?œWho would have thought that after the election of the first black president in the history of the US that we would need a period of reconstruction to try to put this country back together???the sheriff asked rhetorically.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
?œInstead of taking a more neutral tone and trying to get people to stay calm about this matter, he fanned those flames. This was a chance for Barack Obama to have a Gettysburg address moment where he could have asked the country to come back together and heal, and instead all we get out of him is being present.??,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ultimately, Sheriff Clarke said he feels America should have, by now,??as instances of racism are now universally despised, despite President Obama claiming otherwise.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
?œWe have to begin to ask when White society is going to be through paying for the sins of slavery. We?™re now punishing people for sins they didn?™t commit,??the sheriff says. ?œI?™ve forgiven and I?™ve moved on. I?™ve stamped that bill marked for the wrongs of slavery paid in full. This country is now open for opportunities for all people. Instances of discrimination, racism had to go underground. Ok, the president of the united states said a couple of days ago that they were deep rooted, and that?™s simply not true.??,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
?œSo we have to have that discussion as to when we?™re really gonna be ready to move on and forgive people, especially people today who have no connection to what?™s being talked about.??,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When contemplating illegal immigration, here is the transcript of a speech given by ex-Colorado Governor Dick Lamn (D) at a population conference in Washington DC in 2004 to consider:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 If you believe, as many do, that America is too smug, too self-satisfied, too rich,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. We must first make America a bilingual-bicultural country. History shows, in my opinion, that no nation can survive the tension, and antagonism of two competing languages and cultures. It is a blessing for an individual to be bilingual; it is a curse for a society to be bilingual. One scholar, Seymour Martin Lipset, Belgium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2. I would then invent """"multiculturalism"""" and encourage immigrants to maintain their own culture. I would make it an article of belief that all cultures are equal: that there are no cultural differences that are important. I would declare it an article of faith that the black and hispanic dropout rate is only due to prejudice and discrimination by the majority. Every other explanation is out-of-bounds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3. We can make the United States a """"hispanic Quebec"""" without much effort. The key is to celebrate diversity rather than unity. As Benjamin Schwarz said in the Atlantic Monthly recently:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
...achieved not by tolerance but by hegemony. Without the dominance that once dictated ethnocentrically, and what it meant to be an American, we are left with only tolerance and pluralism to hold us together. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I would encourage all immigrants to keep their own language and culture. I would replace the melting pot metaphor with a salad bowl metaphor. It is important to insure that we have various cultural sub-groups living in America reinforcing their differences rather than Americans, emphasizing their similarities.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4. Having done all this, I would make our fastest growing demographic group the least educated - I would add a second underclass, un-assimilated, and antagonistic to our population. I would have this second underclass have a 50% drop out rate from school.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5. I would then get the big foundations and big business to give these efforts lots of money. I would invest in ethnic identity, and I would establish the cult of Victimology. I would get all minorities to think their lack of success was all the fault of the majority - I would start a grievance industry blaming all minority failure on the majority population.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6. I would establish dual citizenship and promote divided loyalties. I would """"Celebrate diversity."""" """"Diversity"""" is a wonderfully seductive word. It stresses differences rather than commonalities. Diverse people worldwide are mostly engaged in hating each other-that is", when they are not killing each other. A diverse, peaceful, and we can take advantage of this myopia. Look at the ancient Greeks. Dorf 's world history tells us: ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Greeks believed that they belonged to the same race; they possessed a common language and literature; and they worshiped the same gods. All Greece took part in the olympic games in honor of Zeus and all Greeks venerated the shrine of Apollo at Delphi. A common enemy Persia threatened their liberty. Yet, all of these bonds together were not strong enough to overcome two factors . . . (local patriotism and geographical conditions that nurtured political divisions . . .) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If we can put the emphasis on the """"pluribus"," instead of the """"unum", we can balkanize America as surely as Kosovo.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"7. Then I would place all these subjects off limits - make it taboo to talk about. I would find a word similar to """"heretic"""" in the 16th century - that stopped discussion and paralyzed thinking. Words like """"racist"""""," """"xenophobe"""" that halts argument and conversation. Having made america a bilingual-bicultural country", having established multiculturalism," I would next make it impossible to enforce our immigration laws. I would develop a mantra - """"that because immigration has been good for America"," it must always be good."""" I would make every individual immigrant sympatric and ignore the cumulative impact.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8. Lastly," I would censor Victor Davis Hanson's book """"Mexifornia."""" This book is dangerous - it exposes my plan to destroy America. So please", please - if you feel that America deserves to be destroyed - please,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the Spectrum of acceptable opinion," but allow very lively debate within that Spectrum."""" - Noam Chomsky", American linguist and US Media and Foreign Policy critic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It sounds like Dick Lamn hit the nail on the head. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However, the question we need to be asking ourselves and members of Congress is:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Why is the plan to destroy America being implemented?""",,https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/13427767_900176396758494_2186957581453977548_n.jpg?oh=12531fcc464172827c9ecd1136460c66&oe=59B5D4D2,,427,08/06/2016 15:41,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Boy, was I wrong.
Apparently, 71% of MSNBC viewers said it?™s perfectly fine for Rachel Dolezal to identify as a black transracial woman:
There?™s weapons-grade stupid walking around in America today, folks.
These liberal idiots, from the dummies who watch and respond to MSNBC polls to boobs likes Michael Eric Dyson, are only giving Dolezal a pass because she?™s a liberal.
The NAACP is the oldest and most useless civil rights organization in America. And Dolezal believed she had to dress up like a black Barbie doll to be the head of her local chapter.
Would these liberal loons give the same pass to a black person (not named Michael Jackson) who identified as white?
Hell no, they wouldn?™t.

As you may already know, KING 5 has been negotiating with DISH to keep our station in its lineup.

Our original deadline was September 30 but we extended that deadline by eight days, giving DISH more time to reach a deal.

Now, we are approaching the new deadline of October 9 at 4 pm and, unfortunately, DISH has not yet agreed to reach a fair, market-based agreement with us.

KING 5 is dedicated to providing all of our viewers the very best news, weather, sports and entertainment programming in our area, and being a part of this community. We are proud of the fact that we have NEVER had a situation where a major distributor stopped carrying our station.

But unless DISH changes course, you could lose some of your favorite programming and your local KING 5 news, weather and sports.

We are as disappointed as you are about this situation. After all, the deal being discussed with DISH is fundamentally similar to the deals we just reached with cable and satellite companies all across the country. And, frankly, we are concerned given DISH?™s recent pattern of taking stations away from its customers. As you may know, just this past August DISH blacked out broadcast networks in multiple markets across the country, impacting millions of families like yours.
 
You can still help us resolve this matter. If you contact DISH and let them know you want KING 5 on air, it may help us reach a deal. Also, you should know you have choices. KING 5 has agreements with every other provider in our area, and we are always available free over-the-air.

1.23061E+14,Unbiased America,123061011213236_421148284737839,Timeline Photos,"Today President Obama made a major address on firearm violence and gun control.  ""I know we won?™t all agree on this issue. But it?™s time to be honest. Fewer gun safety laws don?™t mean more freedom, they mean more fallen officers. They mean more grieving families, and more Americans terrified that they or their loved ones could be next,"" he said.  But is that an ""honest"" assessment?  I decided to look into which variables are associated with firearm homicides, and which aren't.

FIREARM OWNERSHIP RATE: Coefficient = -1.17, Correlation = -0.10, R Squared = 0.01, p>|t| = 0.48.
As I said last week, firearm ownership is not correlated to firearm homicides.  What most gun control advocates don't understand is that gun ownership is not a reason people commit crimes.  If it was, then the states with the most guns would also have the highest homicide rates.  No, people commit murder for other reasons, and if you want to stop homicides, you have to address the motive, not the method.

POPULATION DENSITY: Coefficient = 0.0009, Correlation = -0.15, R Squared = 0.02, p>|t| = 0.29.
Several people have surmised that population density is related to firearm murders.  Although the data shows that it's not, population density isn't really the best measure to apply to states.  It would be better used at the county level, but I don't have that data.  Second, population density probably isn't the cause of homicides as much as it's related to where most homicides occur.  It doesn't help us discover why the murders occur, unless you buy into an argument that living in close proximity to other people makes you violent.

POVERTY RATE: Coefficient = 0.22, Correlation = 0.56, R Squared = 0.32, p>|t| = 0.00002 (very high significance).
Poverty is the first variable to show a correlation to firearm murder rates.  But it would be inaccurate to say poverty causes homicides.  Instead, it seems to be a trait often shared by those who commit murders.  With an R squared of 0.32, it seems poverty explains some, but not most, of the variations in firearm murder rates.

PERCENT OF THE POPULATION THAT IS AFRICAN-AMERICAN: Coefficient = 12.19, Correlation = 0.77, R Squared = 0.60, p>|t| = 0.00000000005 (very high significance).
This variable is the most highly correlated of all that I tested.  With an R squared of 0.60, it explains most of the variation in state firearm murder rates.  But before you go screaming racism, I'm not contending that skin color causes murders.  Remember, correlation does not necessarily indicate causation.  Instead, I believe this data merely confirms that many African-American communities are plagued with a culture of violence that makes firearm homicides much more frequent.  And although most people don't acknowledge this elephant in the room, the statistics support the conclusion.

Although they only make up 12.9% of the population, blacks commit 52.6% of murders according to the FBI.  And 83% of their victims are also black.  So it makes sense that states with higher black populations also have higher rates of murder, which is what the data shows.

If this is indeed a causal relationship, then gun control advocates are focused on the wrong ""solution"".  Instead, addressing the culture of violence in African-American communities should be the focal point of efforts to reduce firearm homicides.

The driver got slugged in the face??
Another protester kicked the woman?™s SUV causing $5,000 in damages.
The two violent protesters were arrested and charged with assault and felony property damages.
The St. Louis Post Dispatch reported:
A prominent figure in the Ferguson protest movement posted bail late Wednesday afternoon and departed the St. Louis County Justice into the arms of cheering supporters who had just ended a brief demonstration on her behalf.
?œIt?™s beautiful,??said Brittany Ferrell, accepting hugs from some of the 75 demonstrators who just moments before had locked arms before a small contingent of Clayton police officers positioned outside the South Central Avenue entrance to the jail.
Ferrell, 26, was freed after posting 10 percent of the $10,000 bail imposed after she was charged with felony property damage, trespass and peace disturbance???¦The interstate shutdown was part of a day of protest action following the anniversary of the shooting of Michael Brown Jr. in Ferguson. Protesters lined up on both sides of the interstate just east of the Blanchette Bridge shortly after 5 p.m. Monday, bringing traffic to a standstill.
One driver who was forced to stop tried to move forward through the line of people, and the protesters tried to stop her SUV, according to court documents.
Templeton punched the driver through her open window, giving the woman a black eye, according to charges. Ferrell kicked the woman?™s vehicle, causing nearly $5,000 in damage, the charges say.
