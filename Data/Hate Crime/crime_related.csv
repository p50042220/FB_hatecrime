And I can’t believe that I’m reading this, which is basically directly in contrast and in conflict with most of the most important values that people in this country hold most dear.

According to the latest Gallup poll, Trump has a net favorability of negative 70 among Democrats and negative 27 among independents. Cruz’s ratings are the second worst; negative 37 among Democrats and minus 3 with independents.


Faced with such a dilemma, the most effective way to confront it would be to find a potential third nominee, one who is not a bombastic demagogue or a uniquely unlikable figure and would have a chance of winning non-Republican votes. Unfortunately, the pickings are slim. There’s Marco Rubio (11 percent in national polls), Jeb Bush (5 percent), and Chris Christie (3.5 percent). None of these three are great candidates. In fact, after Trump, Bush and Christie have the highest unfavorable ratings, with all voters, of any of the Republican candidates.

But they are all less likely to lead the GOP off the cliff toward an electoral shellacking.

So why then are the three so-called establishment candidates taking turns beating each other up? The super PAC for Jeb Bush, who knows a bit about watching his support go over a cliff, has taken the lead. This week it went after Rubio for flip-flopping on immigration (even though the two men largely agree on the issue); and the next day it ran another ad mocking him for his high-heeled boots.

Chris Christie has joined in as well, attacking Rubio for his electability and saying that Hillary Clinton would “cut his heart out” in a presidential debate. But, in fairness to Christie, Rubio started the fight. His super PAC ran an ad criticizing Christie’s record in New Jersey and Rubio joined in the fray by saying that Christie “has a very liberal record for a Republican.”

Rubio, however, wasn’t the only one attacking Christie. Bush’s super PAC sent out mailers in Iowa that criticized the New Jersey governor over the fact that his state’s credit rating has been downgraded “a record nine times” and for embracing “a massive expansion of Obamacare.”


Christie, who is not the type to let any insult go unanswered, struck back, claiming that Bush isn’t prepared for the White House, even though Bush served longer as governor than Christie.

This back-and-forth was on full display Thursday night at the GOP debate, with the only change being Rubio’s willingness to aggressively go after Ted Cruz. He hit the Texas senator for supporting a value-added tax, a charge Cruz denied. Cruz attacked Rubio over immigration; Rubio hit back. He attacked Christie for his support of Planned Parenthood, the Common Core, and gun control; Christie accused Rubio of being a do-nothing Senator. Rubio is today running a new ad that calls Jeb Bush, “desperate.” At least for his part, Bush aimed his barbs at Trump, but few others did.

Rubio, Christie, and Bush have all seemingly made the decision that the only way they can win is by knocking out the other two and then presenting themselves as the sane alternative to the front-runners. To say that is a long-shot strategy is putting it mildly. First of all, pitched political combat between Rubio, Christie, and Bush may weaken two of them more than the other — but it will certainly hurt all three. They will basically be previewing for voters the political attacks that Trump or Cruz will deploy against them if they emerge from the pack.

Second, this strategy is largely conceding Iowa and New Hampshire to Trump and Cruz. At best, the three men are fighting it out to finish second in New Hampshire or third in Iowa.

But what if Rubio gets third place in the Hawkeye State and Christie second in the Granite State? They will keep fighting it out and might even be joined by Bush, who could stay in the race until the Florida primary. This will only help Trump and Cruz.

Moreover, Bush, Christie, and Rubio are unlikely to do well in South Carolina (the next major primary state), and while Rubio might have an outside chance in Nevada, the next caucus state, by that point it won’t matter, especially if Trump wins Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina (not a far-fetched possibility). As the campaign turns to the South, Trump and Cruz will be favored again, which makes even a late Rubio win in Nevada possibly irrelevant.

In short, the three establishment candidates have adopted a strategy of ignoring the front-runners and beating up each other, which can only serve to benefit the front-runners and hurt themselves.

It’s perhaps understandable why they are doing this: Getting in fights with Trump, for example, has not worked out well for any Republican this cycle. But what’s really needed is for the Republican establishment to coalesce around one candidate. That this hasn’t happened to date — and likely won’t in the next three weeks — is a good reminder as to how feckless and incapacitated the GOP establishment has become.

INEQUALITY
“A political society endures when it seeks, as a vocation, to satisfy common needs by stimulating the growth of all its members, especially those in situations of greater vulnerability or risk.”

IMMIGRATION
“We, the people of this continent, are not fearful of foreigners, because most of us were once foreigners. I say this to you as the son of immigrants, knowing that so many of you are also descended from immigrants.”

“On this continent, too, thousands of persons are led to travel north in search of a better life for themselves and for their loved ones, in search of greater opportunities. Is this not what we want for our own children? We must not be taken aback by their numbers, but rather view them as persons, seeing their faces and listening to their stories, trying to respond as best we can to their situation.”

DEATH PENALTY
“Recently my brother bishops here in the United States renewed their call for the abolition of the death penalty. Not only do I support them, but I also offer encouragement to all those who are convinced that a just and necessary punishment must never exclude the dimension of hope and the goal of rehabilitation.”

ARMS TRADE
“Why are deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society? Sadly, the answer, as we all know, is simply for money: money that is drenched in blood, often innocent blood. In the face of this shameful and culpable silence, it is our duty to confront the problem and to stop the arms trade.”

FAMILY
“I cannot hide my concern for the family, which is threatened, perhaps as never before, from within and without. Fundamental relationships are being called into question, as is the very basis of marriage and the family. I can only reiterate the importance and, above all, the richness and the beauty of family life.”

POLITICS

It was pocket-money work with a manager's job as the only hope for advancement.

Now Arzate designs sewer routes for a carpet mill and water lines for residential streets for the local utility company. The catalyst for change in his life was Dalton High School, which introduced him to computer-aided design during a series of manufacturing/ engineering classes, and helped him to line up an internship with the utility. He's going to college and wants a career in civil engineering.

Arzate may be several states removed from Chicago, but his story is one that this region may want to heed. Chicago's economy once rested on the broad shoulders of steel mills and stockyards.

Thomas Simmons, the openly gay Libertarian candidate for Congress in Western Massachusetts’ First District, issued the following statement today in response to the Orlando shooting.

“Words can not convey the depth of heartache that accompanies this terrible tragedy. Just two weeks ago, I was in Orlando at the Libertarian Party National Convention, and patronized the nightclubs in this very neighborhood.  The Pulse was not just a nightclub, but a community epicenter for Orlando’s LGBT community. This horror – occurring during the nation’s Pride celebrations - was made even worse for us all when we learned that at least two of the victims had direct ties to western Massachusetts.

We must never give in to hate, whether that hate is directed against the gay community, immigrants, or the Muslim community.  The politics of hate and division has been all too prevalent in recent political campaigns, and Americans from all walks of life must stand together in refusing to allow our diverse, liberty-loving nation to be torn apart by those who would seek to divide and conquer.

As a gay man, I have long been painfully aware that, statistically, I am more likely to be assaulted than most; for that reason, I have a concealed carry (LTC-A) license for self-protection.  In spite of the fact that I have Homeland Security Clearance through my activities with the U. S. Coast Guard, and have been fingerprinted through the FBI no fewer than eleven times during the course of my life, it still took me more than 8 months to receive this license to carry in Massachusetts.  The fact that it took me 8 months, while the Orlando terrorist was granted a license to work in Private Security after having been investigated by the FBI three times for terrorist connections, points to a breakdown in the nation’s security systems that puts innocent lives at risk while allowing criminal elements to proceed unchecked.

It is a sad reality that we will never live in an incident-free utopia; that simply is not possible.  We must avoid quick, feel-good solutions and clichés in dealing with terrorism, both domestic and foreign, even though our raw emotions might demand action.  Thoughtful but decisive changes – and a commitment to rejecting hate on all sides, while preserving all American’s civil liberties  – is the only way forward.”

Today Dieudonné M’bala M’bala, a prominent stand-up comedian, appears in court on such a charge. He was arrested after posting a message on Facebook after the murders at Charlie Hebdo, a satirical newspaper, and a kosher supermarket, which read: “I feel like I am Charlie Coulibaly.” This was a reference both to the popular slogan in favour of free expression, Je suis Charlie, and to Amédy Coulibaly, the supermarket killer. A conviction could trigger anger among Dieudonné’s followers in France’s heavily Muslim banlieues. Either way, this will not be the end of his judicial troubles.

Some are being tried in absentia (and may even be dead).

An estimated 450 Belgian Muslims are fighting in Syria and Iraq—relative to population, the most in Europe. In January Belgian police carried out a series of raids, killing two returned jihadists said to have been plotting attacks inside the country.

He is accused of espionage: handing national-security documents to Qatari intelligence and Al Jazeera television, owned by Qatar. The Brothers have been outlawed and dubbed terrorists by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who as army chief led the 2013 coup against Mr Morsi. The party will therefore not contest parliamentary elections next month, which the regime says will complete Egypt’s transition to “democratic rule”. Other opposition groups, activists and journalists have also been stifled. Yesterday the retrial started of two Al Jazeera journalists originally sentenced to seven and ten years’ imprisonment for allegedly supporting the Brotherhood; both were freed on bail.

On Monday and Tuesday parliament debated deploying troops there, though security policy is mostly directed by Pakistan’s army; civilians add a patina of legitimacy. Pakistan’s interest is in helping its Sunni Muslim ally and donor, Saudi Arabia, which is bombing the mostly Shia Houthi rebels who have overrun much of Yemen. But participating in the conflict would be risky, not least if it incurs hostility from Iran, which has a 900km frontier with Pakistan and allegedly backs the Houthis.
